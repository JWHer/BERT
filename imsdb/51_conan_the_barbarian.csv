In one fluid motion she swings the sword around her body and drives it into the gap in the Aesir's armor -- at his groin.,1
ISLENE,2
I'd ask you the same.,3

A Cimmerian warrior is like any other man.,3
A Cimmerian warrior feels hunger.,3
He feels cold.,3
Like other men he may lie and cheat.,3

"The bar is filled with the hearty sailors and merchants of those ships, and those who desire to part them from their hard-earned money; Zamoran thieves, Hyborean mercenaries and Brythunian whores.",1
Most of them watch the arm wrestling match taking place at the back of the bar.,1
"A pair of CITY GUARDS, short swords sheathed at their sides, enter the bar and are immediately summoned over by the harried BARKEEP.",1
BARKEEP,2
He's back there.,3
The barkeep motion to the arm wrestlers.,1
CITY GUARD #1,2
What's this one done?,3
BARKEEP,2
What's he done?!,3
What hasn't he done?,3
He's bedded six of my whores and finished off three casks of mead--and he hasn't paid so much as a silver piece for it.,3
CITY GUARD #1,2
So have your men deal with him.,3
BARKEEP,2
I did.,3
"Behind the bar, six men each hold down two HULKING MEN YELLING in agony as their horribly broken arms are snapped back into place.",1
CITY GUARD #2,2
Sounds like a real problem.,3
Too bad we have other places to be right now.,3
"The Barkeep shakes his head, knowing the routine.",1
He slips a pair of silver pieces into the soldier's hand.,1
BARKEEP,2
Just get that behemoth out of here.,3
The two City Guards make their way to the back of the bar.,1
"His back to them, the DRUNKEN MAN they're after struggles to pin his opponent, cobras beneath each of their wrists, ready to strike at the loser.",1
"A pair of voluptuous WHORES watch, caressing the Drunken Man's sinewy back.",1
"The Drunken Man YELLS in fury as he SLAMS the other man's hand down upon the cobra, which immediately bites its prey.",1
"As the soldiers arrive, the drunken victor throws his tankard of ale at the Barkeep, who's now back behind the bar.",1
DRUNKEN MAN,2
Piss-water!,3
"You'll serve my friends and I your best, barman, or you'll taste steel!",3
CITY GUARD #1,2
"Time to leave, northerner.",3
The Drunken Man turns as the City Guard puts a hand on his shoulder.,1
CONAN,2
"The gangly fifteen year old boy has grown into a powerfully built man, broad-shouldered with sun browned skin lined with battle scars.",1
Only the piercing blue eyes and square cut black mane remain from the boy we last saw.,1

Public drunkenness.,3

Conan yawns in response.,1

And you'll get the same if you don't answer.,3
You're accused of public drunkenness.,3
How do you plead?,3
CONAN,2
"In truth, I've been guilty of much.",3
"Jewels stolen from the crowns of kings, men's heads split in battle for the price of a night's drink.",3
But through that I've searched and waited and hunted my prey.,3

OASIS,5

"At its far end, beyond a deep blue pond, lies a Greek- influenced monastery and several tiled-roof, mud-brick houses.",1
And moving between the pools are MEN and WOMEN going about their simple chores.,1
They wear long flowing white linen robes and turbans.,1
The air and sand are perfectly still within the perimeter of the oasis.,1
"But beyond it, the sandstorm rages all around, sand hurled violently hundreds of feet into the air, swirling around the oasis as though it were the eye of some mystical hurricane, protected by an unseen force.",1
"A row of robed YOUNG WOMEN kneel in front of one of the reflecting pools, quietly reading from prayer books and softly striking their right breast with a left hands wrapped in thorns.",1
"One girl, ILIRA, mischievously taps the shoulder of the girl next to her with her thorn.",1

This is the road to Khor Kalba.,3
Ahead.,3
Past the Great Wall.,3
The Slaver nods to the east and Conan releases his arm.,1
The Slaver continues whipping the slave.,1
Conan just rides on - - not his problem.,1
"But as Conan passes Tamara, for a brief moment their eyes meet.",1
Something about her.,1
"Conan stares a moment, then spurs his horse on.",1
"Just then, the ground around them RUMBLES.",1
"Horses rear, the women SCREAM.",1
Conan turns and looks up.,1
His eyes go wide.,1
ENORMOUS BOULDERS,2
Coming thundering down the hills on all sides.,1
The SLAVERS see them a moment to late.,1
SLAM.,1
Several of the horses and carts are smashed by the rolling boulders.,1
"Conan kicks his horse, trying to outrace the boulders.",1
"But when the wagon next to him is hit, its axle spears his horse in its side, and Conan goes down.",1
"Pissed, he draws his sword.",1
"The Slavers scramble around the broken wagons, in chaos.",1
Only a pair of wagons still stands.,1
One of them holds Tamara.,1
CONAN,2
Use your whips on the horses' legs!,3
The Slavers are confused.,1
TURANIAN HORSEMEN,2
"Then they notice racing down the hill, behind the boulders.",1
"As the riders bear down upon the slavers, the Slavers do as they're told, entangling the legs of the first wave of horses, throwing their riders.",1
More than a few riders SNAP their necks as they're driven into the desert floor.,1
"The remainder fight hand to hand, and are cut down by either Conan's blade or the slavers' tulwars.",1
"But their victory is short lived -- As a SECOND WAVE OF RIDERS comes thundering towards them, before the Slavers can re-establish their perimeter.",1
The riders start cutting the slavers down where they stand.,1
CONAN,2
Conan lodges his sword in a still-rolling boulder.,1
"As it rolls, it pulls him up on top of it.",1
"From this height, Conan launches himself down at the horsemen below.",1
WHAM!,1
"He knocks a rider off his horse, Conan landing square in the saddle.",1
He kicks the horse straight at the other riders.,1
They don't see him coming until it's too late.,1
He cuts them down where they sit.,1
"The last remaining CARAVAN DRIVER whips his horse team, trying to pull his wagon out of the fight.",1
Conan spins to see a FLASH of steel and the rider's neck plumes in blood as he's decapitated.,1
Which is strange since the cavalry are nowhere near the wagon.,1
REMO,2
"The explanation comes as the shadow behind the driver MORPHS into Remo, the spindly Shadow Scout.",1
"He takes the reins, stopping the wagon.",1
"Conan spots him, recognition in his eyes.",1
CONAN,2
You!,3
There's a SCREAM.,1
Conan turns to see the other two SHADOW SCOUTS already hacking their way through the slaves on one of the caged wagons.,1
"A Shadow Scout gets to Tamara, only to have her FIGHT BACK.",1
"Tamara kicks the first Scout in the face, slamming his head into the bars.",1
"However, the second one clubs her unconscious from behind.",1
CONAN,2
"Leaps from his horse, launching his body at Remo.",1
Remo dives and rolls away.,1
"Small and misshapen, he is nonetheless very fast.",1
Conan strikes again.,1
Again Remo dodges out of the way.,1
"The Shadow Scouts draw swords, but Remo waves them off, speaking in the broken language of a savage.",1
REMO,2
The girl!,3
Bring her to Khalar!,3
Conan launches an all out attack.,1
"Remo leaps over his sword and vaults Conan, landing on his back.",1
"He draws his sword,",1
"preparing to cut Conan's throat -- When Conan hurls his body backwards, into one of the huge rolling boulders.",1
The impact crushes Remo and he loses his grip.,1
Cona,5
"spins to strike again, only to see Remo MELT INTO THE",6
SHADOW OF THE BOULDER.,1
Conan turns his attention towards the other two Shadow Scouts as they drag the unconscious Tamara away.,1

TAMARA,2
Stop!,3
I want water.,3
Conan just keeps riding.,1
CONAN,2
Perhaps the slavers took your orders.,3
I don't.,3
TAMARA,2
I never knew men could be so cruel.,3
Now I wonder if the world is filled with animals such as you.,3
CONAN,2
You speak of animals as if they were less than men.,3
But animals don't stab their brothers in the back or steal their mother's only possession.,3
And they never lie.,3
TAMARA,2
I haven't lied.,3
"Conan get off his horse, unties Tamara and gives her a water sack.",1
Tamara greedily drinks down the water.,1

Trying to poison me?,3
"Tamara steps back and gets down on her knees, her hands clasped.",1

What are you doing?,3
TAMARA,2
"Before we eat, I must pray.",3
CONAN,2

What would you pray for?,3
That a bone may not get stuck in your throat?,3
No words nor gods will give you one more moment than fate allows you.,3
TAMARA,2
Then you have no faith.,3
And I am sorry for you.,3
CONAN,2
I need no pity.,3
TAMARA,2
But you do.,3
You live in a world that is harsh and short.,3
Where fate is unyielding and hope is a cruel joke.,3

You will return to Khor Kalba.,3
You will feed the women to the beast until you find our Queen.,3
FARIQ,2
I will not.,3
"Enraged, Khalar Singh grabs him by the back of his head, pulling him in close.",1
KHALAR SINGH,2
I will track the barbarian with you -- You think I care what you wish?!,3
You want to play warrior?,3
It is not in you.,3
"One day you will be king, but warlord, never.",3
FARIQ,2
I can.,3
KHALAR SINGH,2
Let me prove it to you!,3
You will not risk your life again.,3
"You are my line, my successor.",3
You will not throw away all that I have worked for.,3

What are you waiting for?,3
The fire is dying.,3
Conan turns back to the wood pile.,1
"Instead of wood, the pile is full of the bodies of those he recently killed:",1
"Lucius, Remo, etc.",1
The young Conan struggles to push the first body onto the forge.,1
Still the fire diminishes.,1
Conan turns and there is no more wood.,1
And no more bodies.,1
CONAN,2
It's not enough.,3
I've failed you father.,3

"He looks to his wounds, all bandaged.",1
He rises--a bit too fast because he falls back to his bed.,1
TAMARA,2
I wouldn't move so fast.,3
"I bound your wounds as best I could, but I'm no healer.",3
Conan looks over to discover Tamara sitting nearby.,1
CONAN,2
Where am I?,3
TAMARA,2
On the Wasp.,3
"You told me where it laid, just before you passed out.",3
Though I can't say as I feel much safer here.,3

"Don't embarrass me with thanks, I only saved your life.",3

I was just wondering what that smell was.,3

Now I know.,3
ARTUS,2
We take no stowaways.,3
Only paying passengers.,3
You've best be laden with gold.,3

CONAN,2

CONAN,2
You would risk your life for royalty?,3
Why?,3
"Tamara pauses, realizing she must trust Conan to gain his help.",1
TAMARA,2
"Because she represent freedom, not just ours but all Hyboria's.",3
What do you know of Acheron?,3
CONAN,2
A tall tale.,3
Meant to scare children.,3
TAMARA,2
It is no fable.,3
It's my people's history.,3
"Acheron was an empire that swallowed all of Hyboria, led by the King and his legion of demon warriors.",3
Unstoppable.,3
Insatiable.,3
Immortal.,3
But still it had one weakness.,3
"For the true power of Acheron laid not with its King, but the Queen.",3
"Every twenty years, a new queen from the royal line would be coronated with a crown of iron.",3
"Spikes would pierce her, slowly drain her precious blood, and through her suffering Acheron would remain invincible.",3
"Until one of my ancestors, an Acheronian himself, put a stop to this tyranny.",3
"He and others spirited the new Queen away, hiding her from the empire and all those who would raise it again.",3
CONAN,2
What care I for queens and empires?,3
Conan turns to head back to his bed.,1
"Tamara grabs him, incensed.",1
TAMARA,2
Didn't you hear me?,3
This evil faces us all.,3
All of civilization will fall if the army of Acheron is raised again.,3

I heard.,3
"Only I would happily put all of your ""civilization"" to the torch myself.",3

We sailed with him for a while.,3
I would like to say I know the man.,3
TAMARA,2
He is a riddle to me.,3
ARTUS,2
"Aye, he's that too.",3
TAMARA,2
We have the same goal.,3
Why will he not trust me?,3
ARTUS,2
Why would he?,3
He's a stranger in every land he trods.,3
"A man with no home, no people, none but the company of ghosts.",3
And he bears the weight of their deaths every moment of every day.,3
TAMARA,2
That is no way to live.,3
ARTUS,2
He doesn't live.,3
"I've seen in him great mirth, only to watch it smothered by greater melancholy.",3

He silently stalks prey with nothing more than a knife.,1
A BOAR,2
"Its ears listen intently, aware.",1
"Suddenly, it bolts.",1
CONAN,2
"Is just as quick, racing through the forest on a intercepting course with the great beast.",1
"He leaps over a fallen log, throwing his dagger with a sweep of his arm.",1
"The boar goes down, the blade through its jugular.",1
"Conan walks up to the struggling beast, showing no satisfaction as he mercifully SNAPS its neck.",1
INT.,5
COLOSSUS HEAD,5
NIGHT,6
The great haunches of the beast roast over the fire.,1
Conan turns the meat.,1
"Behind him, Tamara approaches.",1
"She has cleaned herself up, her white robe translucent in light of the fire, her wet hair glistening.",1
"Conan can't help but notice her supple skin, her curves.",1
He stops chewing.,1
Tamara notices.,1
"Embarrassed, she turns so that he can only see her side.",1
Conan returns to his food.,1
TAMARA,2
"What were the women of your tribe like, Conan?",3
CONAN,2
They fought beside the men.,3
TAMARA,2
So they were equals.,3
And your mother?,3
CONAN,2
"She died in battle, even as I was born.",3
TAMARA,2
So you never knew her.,3
It was the same with me.,3
I've always known being a mother was somehow not my fate.,3
"Tamara falters, unsure.",1
But Conan's quiet eases her.,1
TAMARA,2
But-- You said earlier Khor Kalba will bring only death.,3
"Were you trying to scare me, or do you really believe our end lies there?",3
CONAN,2
I don't lie.,3
"Tamara nods, having heard as much about Conan.",1
"She turns back to face him, no longer hiding her body.",1
TAMARA,2
Then we don't have much time.,3
"Your mother perished too young, but at least she died having known the touch of one who cared.",3
Tamara steps closer to Conan.,1
TAMARA,2
"So -- do you care, Conan?",3
"Conan rises to her, his broad form looming over her slight build.",1
"But Conan shows surprising gentleness as he removes her robe and pulls her naked body into his, their mouths meeting in a desperate kiss.",1
LOVE SCENE,2
"Conan lies atop Tamara by the fire, their sinewy limbs intertwined, fingers locked together.",1
"He thrusts into her, causing her face to contort in pleasure and pain.",1
"The fire grows brighter as Tamara rolls on top, undulating as their pace quickens.",1
Tamara CRIES OUT in ecstasy.,1
AFTERMATH,2
"Tamara stares into the fire, her body wrapped around Conan's.",1
She gently caresses the notched scars cut into his arm.,1
TAMARA,2
"I've only ever heard you speak of what you'd die for, Conan.",3
What would you live for?,3
"Conan, his eyes closed, keeps them shut.",1
CONAN,2
Do you ever tire of talking?,3
"Let me rest, woman.",3
Tamara reaches down between Conan's legs.,1
His eyes open.,1
TAMARA,2
I thought that may work.,3
Conan growls and pulls himself atop Tamara.,1
"Looking down at her face, her hair loose and wild, she's beautiful in the soft glow of the firelight.",1
TAMARA,2
"I see you clearly now, finally, after all this time.",3
(she kisses him deeply),3
"I would be that which you live for, Conan, if you would have me.",3
"You may have faith in nothing, Conan -- but I have faith in you.",3
Conan lowers himself back down upon her.,1

"Conan powers his way to the top of a high ridge, spotting down in the vista below:",1
KHOR KALBA,2
"Surrounded on three sides by the coastline, the stone fortress of Khalar Singh rests on a plateau, overlooking a bustling, tented city below.",1
"Conan spots a long CARAVAN of packed camels working their way towards town, driven by DESERT TRADERS from Shem.",1
CONAN,2
"We'll slip in, along with those traders.",3
"But you'll need a change of clothes, those monks' robes will draw attention.",3
Tamara looks down at her loose-fitting robes.,1
TAMARA,2
What will I wear?,3
EXT.,5
KHOR KHALBA,5
ENTRANCE,5
DAY,6
"The caravan rides up to the walled entrance to the city, guarded by Khalar's troops.",1
"Blended in amongst the others, Conan now wears the elaborate head scarf and clothes of Shemish traders, obscuring all but his eyes.",1
TAMARA,2
"Tamara is dressed like a Shemish serving girl, her taut body barely covered by silken drapings.",1
"She glares at Conan, miserable.",1
TAMARA,2
I don't understand why I couldn't be dressed as you are.,3
I look like a whore.,3
CONAN,2
And what better disguise for a monk?,3
Conan tugs on the rope for the camel to move faster.,1
The Camel BRAYS and rears.,1
"Conan yanks harder and the camel flies forward, its eyes wide.",1
Conan meets its eye.,1
CONAN,2
"Do not test me, beast.",3
TAMARA,2
Is there not a living thing you can be at peace with?,3
"They ride into the city, past the troops.",1
EXT.,5
KHOR KHALBA CITY,5
ENTRANCE,5
DAY,6
"Conan and Tamara walk through the town's teeming market, a otherworldly bazaar replete with animal sacrifices, veiled faces and not a hint of morality.",1
STRANGER,2
"A FIGURE, his form hidden beneath a cloak, spots Conan and Tamara as they enter, and begins to follow them.",1
WOODEN PLATFORM,2
The city ends at the sheer cliff wall at the bottom of the plateau.,1
"There stands a WOODEN PLATFORM that is lowered by a massive winch, unloading a cavalry regiment and then raising back up to the fortress above.",1
CONAN,2
It's probably only way into Khalar's fortress.,3
"I'm sure it is heavily guarded at all times, day and night.",3
TAMARA,2
So we must try to scale the cliff.,3
CONAN,2
And dodge arrows as we do so?,3
Conan motions up to the winch.,1
Standing beside it are a half dozen of the four-armed ARCHERS.,1
CONAN,2
"During the day, we'd easily be spotted on the climb.",3
And it would be useless to even attempt at night.,3
"No, we must find another way.",3
STRANGER'S POV,2
"As Conan continues around the base of the mesa, the Figure following Conan is joined by TWO OTHERS.",1
ALLEYWAY,2
Conan and Tamara reach a less crowded area of the village when a VOICE rings out behind them.,1
VOICE ,2
Halt.,3
"Conan spins, sword at the ready.",1
"From out of the shadows comes a pair of MEN, their beady eyes fixed on Tamara.",1
CONAN,2
Thieves.,3
You'll regret finding me.,3
VOICE ,2
I think not.,3
"From out of the shadows steps the ONE-EYED THIEF, the same one who Conan saved from Lucius' beatings.",1
ONE EYED THIEF,2
It took longer than you think to cut this out of Lucius' stomach.,3
"After all that work, I figured I'd keep it -- for old times' sake.",3
INT.,5
THIEVES' TAVERN,5
AFTERNOON,6
"He smiles at Conan, lifting a KEY from a rope around his neck A rundown hall, built beneath the city.",1
Wooden supports hold up the buildings of the entire city block overhead.,1
"And within the hall, a gathering of THIEVES and ROGUES.",1
"They're a flinty collection, many of them missing fingers or even hands, evidence of Khalar's cruel justice.",1
"They eat and drink, sharing tales and tips, WENCHES and SERVING WOMEN their cautious eyes following the Cimmerian outsider.",1
"The One Eyed Thief takes them to an open table, and immediately three of the serving women descend upon Conan, caressing him.",1
"Tamara watches this, jaw dropped, and manages a COUGH, even as a SERVING GIRL delivers mead to the table.",1
"Conan just smiles as he enjoys the silky bodies of the nubile women, their breasts practically framing his face.",1
CONAN,2
What?,3
Do you wish to join in?,3
CUT TO:,0
"Conan cleans mead from his face, scowling at Tamara, as the One-Eyed Thief uses the tabletop to explain the fortress.",1
ONE EYED THIEF,2
so you were right about the platform.,3
You'll be long dead before you make it top.,3
Same with scaling the cliff.,3
There's no known way to break into the fortress.,3
CONAN,2
So that's it?,3
ONE EYED THIEF,2
I didn't say that.,3
I just said there's no known way in -- because no one has ever tried to.,3
But breaking out -- that's another story.,3
"It's not much easier, but it's possible.",3
The One Eyed Thief offers the same gap-toothed grin.,1
ONE EYED THIEF,2
You just need to find someone crazy enough to show you the way.,3
INT.,5
SEWERS,5
NIGHT,6
"Tamara is the last to follow Conan, the One Eyed Thief and the three THIEVES from before down a short ladder.",1
"Below lies a darkened catacomb, lit only by their torches.",1
ONE EYED THIEF,2
"These catacombs run underneath the entire city, even to the cistern that drains out from the fortress dungeon.",3
Tamara's foot drops into knee high water.,1
She immediately grabs her nose.,1
TAMARA,2
Catacombs?,3
You mean sewers.,3
ONE EYED THIEF,2
Piss and shit are the last things you need to worry about down here.,3
"Tamara eyes the muddy water, nothing visible beneath its murky surface.",1
INT.,5
OTHER SEWERS,5
NIGHT,6
"The group wades through the water, single file.",1
Conan notices HIEROGLYPHICS and carvings on the wall of the catacomb.,1
"Massive creatures of the sea, dark sorcery, ritual sacrifice.",1
CONAN,2
What is it?,3
TAMARA,2
A warning.,3
These catacombs are connected to the sea.,3
It says that the beasts of Acheron protect its secrets.,3
CONAN,2
Not from me.,3
"Conan presses on, into the darkness.",1
INT.,5
CISTERN,5
NIGHT,6
"The catacomb widens out to a giant circular cistern, its walls rising up high into the darkness.",1
"As the torches bring light to the space, we see HUNDREDS OF DEAD, ROTTING BODIES.",1
"As Conan and Tamara walk forward, the One Eyed Thief and the other stop at the entrance.",1
ONE EYED THIEF,2
"Sorry, friend.",3
We stop here.,3
We've heard too much about what lies within to go any further.,3
Conan simply nods and the thieves depart.,1
"Conan raises his torch, illuminating the near wall.",1
TAMARA,2
Where now?,3
CONAN,2
Around.,3
Up.,3
"Conan heads off one direction, leaving Tamara to navigate the other half.",1
Her torch illuminates the grizzly path ahead.,1
She inhales deeply and takes her first step.,1
CONAN,2
"Following the slick wall, he passes many DEAD BODIES, but only one catches his eye.",1
He stops before it.,1
DEAD WARRIOR,2
"Nothing more than a skeleton, picked clean by the rats.",1
"But he still bears his leather armor, and a horned helmet that resembles his father's own.",1
Conan takes the helmet and places it on his head.,1
It fits perfectly.,1
TAMARA,2
Tamara is gingerly making her way through the knee high sewage water and the dead bodies submerged within.,1
TAMARA,2
Oh!!!,3
"Tamara leaps up, swinging the torch down towards the water.",1
"Conan, nearby, unsheathes his sword.",1
CONAN,2
What?,3
TAMARA,2
Something touched me.,3
Something slimy.,3
"Conan walks over, the torchlight revealing something on Tamara's leg.",1
"It's a SLUG, which he flicks off.",1
CONAN,2
Crom!,3
Stop wasting time.,3
"But when Conan steps forward, something ROILS THE WATER right before him.",1
He spots a HUGE TENTACLE just before its submerges back into the water.,1
CONAN,2
Crom indeed.,3
"Then Tamara SCREAMS as another tentacle rises up from the water, wrapping around her waist.",1
Tamara grabs hold of the wall as the tentacle tries to pull her underwater.,1
"Conan immediately SLASHES the tentacle, pulling Tamara away.",1
"The squirming decapitated tentacle squirts black blood everywhere, the knee high water seems to come alive with roiling intensity.",1
"Conan spins, finding a circular stone staircase tiled into the far cistern wall.",1

Let's go.,3

"Carved out of solid black rock, both sides of the broad corridor are occasionally punctuated by thick steel doors, leading to prison cells.",1
"Conan and Tamara emerge from a sewer drain, pushing their way to the floor of the hallway.",1
"The heavy darkness presses in on Conan's torch like a sentient, animate thing.",1
"The floor of the corridor is lined with DEAD BODIES, in varying states of decay.",1
"There are buckets, filled with entrails and feces, upended.",1
Tamara put her hand over her mouth.,1
Conan continues down the hallway.,1
He and Tamara begin to hear the sound of EERIE CHANTING.,1
TAMARA,2
What is that?,3
"Up ahead, the torch-lined dungeon plunges into darkness as the torches end.",1
"Conan holds up his own torch, struggling to peer into the black void.",1
CONAN,2
Nothing good.,3
Conan takes a step forward when suddenly a POWERFUL WIND blows out his torch.,1
GATE,5
WHISTLING DOWN AND CRASHING INTO THE GROUND.,6
"A moment later, there's the sound of A In the darkness, comes a DEEP, EARTHY CHUCKLE.",1

Welcome.,3
"A HOST OF OIL LIGHTS SUDDENLY COME UP, revealing that the gate that closed behind them was actually just a door to a vast CAGE built around a massive PIT.",1
INT.,5
THE PIT,5
NIGHT,6
"The same pit where Fariq sacrificed the female monk, only now, a half dozen COMBATANTS stand on the grid above the void.",1
"Hanging high above the pit, in baskets, lie other PRISONERS, including Tamara's fellow female monks.",1
Several of them YELL out Tamara's name as they see her.,1
"And watching everything, from an amphitheater above the cage, is the massive Akhun and several of his slavers.",1
AKHUN,2
"Which ever one of you slaves gets me the girl, lives.",3
"The Combatants all close in on Conan and Tamara, each taking a different plank way to get to them.",1
CONAN,2
(TO TAMARA),4
Stay behind me.,3
"Tamara steps behind Conan, who blocks the others' path to her.",1
CONAN,2
Who dies first?,3
"The first two COMBATANTS attack as one, the first wielding a short sword, the other a pike.",1
"The pikeman thrusts first, Conan deftly stepping aside, then pulling the pike, sending the wielder off balance and into the abyss.",1
"The prisoner with the short sword doesn't fare much better, as Conan evades his swipe and decapitates him with a single blow.",1
TAMARA,2
Tamara sees that the prisoner baskets are suspended by the top half of the metallic cage.,1
"She begins scaling the cage, her eyes set upon the imprisoned monks.",1
CONAN,2
Three more COMBATANTS step in to replace the fallen duo.,1
"Conan readies himself as the first one steps up, only to have the combatant suddenly grabbed by a ENORMOUS TENTACLE, much like the one Conan cut through earlier.",1
TENTACLED MONSTER,2
"Up from the darkness of the pit comes a gargantuan monster; a gigantic octopus-like behemoth, with multiple tentacles that feed a pulsing black orifice lined with razor sharp teeth.",1
"The creature reaches out and grabs another SCREAMING combatants, lowering him to its mouth and devouring him in its gnashing maw.",1
"The creature reaches for Conan, who ducks underneath the tentacle, the slices it off.",1
He immediately turns back to check on Tamara -- and he discovers she's not there.,1
"He looks up to see Tamara scaling the cage, now nearly fifty feet directly above him.",1
CONAN,2
Crom!,3
AKHUN,2
The massive warrior spots Tamara getting close to the prisoner baskets and motions to his two Jailers.,1
AKHUN,2
Get her!,3
TAMARA,2
"She's reached the base of the chain supporting one of the baskets when she spots the two Jailers closing in, climbing towards her from either side.",1
CONAN,2
"Spotting Tamara overhead, Conan tries to keep beneath her, evading the swarming tentacles while balancing on the rickety planks.",1
TAMARA,2
She's scaling down the basket supporting chain when the first Jailer reaches out to grab her.,1
"She reacts by GASHING his eyes, and as he instinctively grabs them, he FALLS TOWARDS THE PIT.",1
CONAN,2
"Conan barely dives out of the way as the fallen Jailer SMASHES through the plank he was on, forcing Conan to jump to another.",1
"Just then another COMBATANT comes swinging for the Cimmerian, forcing him to defend while still not balanced.",1
TAMARA,2
"The next Jailer grabs her, pulling her off the cage.",1
He struggles to pull towards a nearby exit hatch when she BITES HIS EAR OFF.,1
"The Jailer drops Tamara, who SCREAMS as she falls.",1
CONAN,2
Conan spots Tamara plunging towards him.,1
"In one swift move, he SLASHES his opponent, ducks underneath a writhing tentacle, and reaches out to GRAB TAMARA BY THE ARM AS SHE FALLS.",1
"His shoulder nearly pops out, but he manages to hold onto Tamara.",1
TAMARA,2
"She swings above the chasm, the gnashing teeth of the monster below her.",1
Only a single splintering plank holds her and Conan aloft.,1
CONAN,2
"With a grunt, he swings Tamara and throws her to safety, at the edge of the pit.",1
"But as he gets to his feet, he spots the massive Akhun entering the arena.",1
AKHUN,2
The giant warrior grins as he boards the same plank as Conan.,1
"He thrusts his thunderous legs down, causing the plank to bend and warp.",1
"Conan struggle to balance on the undulating plank, but his training in Cimmeria serves him well.",1
"Akhun smiles and step closer, again thrusting down with his legs.",1
"Conan's balance is thrown, but there's no other plank close enough for him to jump to.",1
AKHUN,2
You'll make a nice meal.,3
Cona,5
uses the momentum to SPRINGBOARD UP INTO AIR.,6
"Akhun steps down on the plank one last time, but this time Conan soars into the air, his cat-like reflexes keeping him focused as he lands right before the stunned Akhun.",1
"With one great slash of his blade, Conan eviscerates Akhun.",1
"Akhun's innards drop out of his belly as he falls into the abyss, only to be snapped up by the massive beast.",1

TAMARA,2
Where is Ilira?,3
FEMALE MONK,2
She was taken away by Fariq.,3
TAMARA,2
Then I'm too late.,3
"One of the stronger looking women, an ELDER MONK, steps forward.",1
ELDER MONK,2
No.,3
She was just taken this morning.,3
"It's not yet midnight, and Khalar still must bring her to the cave of Acheron.",3
Tamara nods and the women begin to ARM THEMSELVES.,1
Conan shakes his head at the rag-tag group.,1
CONAN,2
You're going to fight Khalar's troops?,3
Just you?,3
"The Elder Monk grabs and nearby pike and twirls it expertly about her body, clearly well versed in it use.",1
TAMARA,2
Cimmerians aren't the only women who know how to fight.,3
And to kill.,3
Tamara looks at the other monks.,1
TAMARA,2
Our duty was to keep the queen safe.,3
We failed.,3
"But if Khalar brings her to Acheron, it will rise again -- and all our peoples' sacrifice is for nothing.",3
(MORE),4
TAMARA,2
So if the queen is not free by the stroke of midnight -- she must be already dead.,3
The other monks nod and they start to head off.,1
"Tamara is the last to head off, her eyes burning into Conan's.",1
CONAN,2
You want my help again.,3

"Conan's thrusts forward, only to find his armed chained around a heavy mortar and stone pillar.",1
Fariq strokes his newly acquired scar.,1
FARIQ,2
"At last you awaken, Cimmerian.",3
It's been hours you've made me wait for my fun.,3
"Conan says nothing, but his eyes scan the room, taking in everything.",1
FARIQ,2
You made me lose face in front of my father.,3
That wasn't wise.,3
But what should I expect from a Cimmerian?,3
CONAN,2
A swift end!,3
"Conan strains at the chain, ripping the skin beneath his",1
shackles -- but a thin wisp of mortar comes loose from the pillar.,1
FARIQ,2
Hardly.,3
But that is a difference between you and me.,3
A swift end would be a mercy I do not intend to grant.,3
"No, you must suffer for your transgressions.",3
(MORE),4
FARIQ,2
You must beg for your suffering to end.,3
Just as your people did.,3
He waves the glowing sword tip in front of Conan's face.,1
CONAN,2
You lie.,3
I was there.,3
My father never uttered a sound.,3
"Fariq LAUGHS, amused.",1
FARIQ,2
You were there?,3
"What were you doing, warrior?",3
"Watching your father die, without saying a sound?",3
"Taking your eyes will be justice indeed, coward.",3
Fariq pushes the hot tip of the sword against Conan's skin.,1
"Conan's face reddens with pain, but he doesn't utter a sound.",1
But as Conan pulls on his chains -- more mortar falls.,1
"As Fariq turns back to place the sword in the forge, Conan notices one of the bricks the chains are fastened to is LOOSE.",1
CONAN,2
I saw my father die.,3
Slain by one who can only kill men already on their knees.,3

FARIQ,2
"I've killed many in battle, cur.",3
CONAN,2
Really?,3
"Then why did your father not let you face me before, when I had sword in hand.",3
He thought you unequal to the task.,3
Fariq responds by pushing the red hot blade against Conan's chest.,1
Conan just YELLS back at him.,1
CONAN,2
Coward!,3
Prove your strength!,3
"Again, Fariq pushes the hot blade against Conan's skin.",1
CONAN,2
"Take my eyes, coward -- if you can.",3
Fariq yells and thrust the tip of the sword at Conan's head.,1
"Conan lifts his manacles, forcing the blade up into the brick holding his chain.",1

"A massive SKULL, seemingly a natural rock formation, rises over the peninsula.",1
"As they ride closer, we can make out one more detail -- the mouth of the skull is actually a massive door, at least sixty feet high, and seemingly made up of jagged bone.",1
"It has the appearance of teeth, completing the skull illusion.",1
INT.,5
ACHERON CAVE,5
NIGHT,6
It takes the full complement of soldiers to open the enormous doors.,1
Khalar Singh rides in.,1
Moonlight from the huge eyes of the skull illuminate terrifying faces in the darkness.,1
Faces of demonic warrior statues.,1
"At their feet lie the decaying bones of human skeletons, too numerous to count.",1
TAMARA,2
"This is no empire, only a graveyard.",3
KHALAR SINGH,2
You see only with your eyes.,3
Khalar nods to his men.,1
Two Guardsmen take their torches and light other torches set in the walls.,1
It sets off a chain reaction.,1
As far as the eye can see torches ignite revealing the true scope of this place.,1
"An enormous cave, the walls lined with monumental columns that frame countless bas relief carvings of demonic origin.",1
"And at the far of the cave, an ALTAR sits beneath a raised THRONE, surrounded by a SACRIFICIAL POOL.",1
The pool is empty.,1
Khalar turns to his guards.,1
KHALAR SINGH,2
Close the gates and stay here.,3
Send my son to me when he arrives.,3
(motioning to two of them),3
"You two, come with me.",3
THE ALTAR,2
"Khalar dismounts at the sacrificial altar, carved of out of purple-shaded rock.",1
"Around its edges are deep channels, for the blood of its victims.",1
And on its four corners -- shackles of bone.,1
KHALAR SINGH,2
"The Acheronians had a wonderful sense of balance, don't you think?",3
"For one to ascend to royalty, another must fall.",3
"With the flick of a wrist, Khalar cuts Tamara's bonds.",1
"Tamara head butts him, struggling to escape, but Khalar absorbs the blow effortlessly.",1
"He throws Tamara upon the altar, his two guards shackling her in place.",1
KHALAR SINGH,2
"For a hundred generations the kings of Acheron were crowned, and the queens were sacrificed.",3
"Khalar snaps his fingers and two guardsmen bring an ornately carved BOX MADE OF BONE, laying it before the altar.",1
"Like a Chinese puzzle box, Khalar manipulates the carvings of skulls, sacrifices, and creatures until the box UNLATCHES.",1
And from the box he lifts two items.,1
A CROWN OF GOLD and A CROWN OF IRON.,1
"The crown of gold is magnificent, ornately detailed gold that glows in the firelight.",1
But the crown of iron is terrifying.,1
Huge rough spikes extend from it in every direction.,1
It looks more like a weapon than a crown.,1
KHALAR SINGH,2
What a day for you.,3
This morning you were a handmaiden.,3
"Tonight, you are a queen giving birth to an empire.",3

NIGHT,6
"Bloodied and weary, Conan approaches the Skull Rock.",1
"He has nothing more than his sword, his loincloth and a small BURLAP SACK tied to his hip.",1
"He stumbles, falling to his knees.",1
His wounds have taken a grave toll.,1
Still he stands and presses on.,1
He pushes on the doors.,1
They do not budge in the least.,1
He,1
puts his shoulder to the doors -- his every muscle straining to their utmost.,1
Again -- no movement.,1
"Conan backs away, taking stock of the surroundings.",1
He climbs up the side of the rock.,1
INT.,5
ACHERON CAVE,5
NIGHT,6
Khalar Singh CHANTS in Acheronian.,1
"Ancient, harsh words, as he lifts the two crowns overhead, offering them to the statues of dark gods all around.",1
TAMARA,2
Stop.,3
You don't know what you are about to do.,3
KHALAR SINGH,2
But I do.,3
For thirty years I have dreamed of this day.,3
The day our people rise from the ashes.,3
Khalar Singh continues his chant and places the gold crown upon his head.,1
"As he does so, the light from the moon reflects off the crown, bathing the sacrificial pool in an unnatural glow.",1
THUMP-THUMP.,1
"A deep and foreboding sound echoes throughout the cave, shaking everything like an earthquake.",1
It sounds like the heartbeat of a giant.,1
Khalar next places the iron crown around Tamara's head.,1
She thrashes and struggles but to no avail.,1
THEM,5
ELVES INTO HER HEAD. She SCREAMS in agony.,6
Once the crown is around her head -- THUMP-THUMP!,1
"The spikes around the iron crown grow shorter AS THE SPIKES DRIVE Blood drips from beneath the crown, flowing into channels around the edges of the altar.",1
KHALAR SINGH,2
It begins.,3
You give birth to an empire.,3
EXT.,5
THE SIDE OF THE SKULL,5
NIGHT,6
Conan climbs -- muscles straining -- slipping -- hanging on by one hand -- and climbing again.,1
THUMP-THUMP.,1
"The statuary shakes, indeed the whole earth does.",1
"Conan nearly slips, but keeps his grip.",1
CONAN,2
Crom.,3
He reaches the eye of the skull.,1
REVERSE ANGLE,2
"With the moon over his shoulder, Conan stares down at the unholy sight before him.",1
"We pull back revealing Tamara, her blood draining from her body.",1
INT.,5
ACHERON CAVE,5
CONTINUOUS,1
"Tamara, her face pale from blood loss, begins to pray in pained whispers.",1
KHALAR SINGH,2
It's good that you pray.,3
Gods will be here soon.,3
"Tamara struggles to speak, her body wracked with pain.",1
TAMARA,2
He'll--be---here--sooner.,3
KHALAR SINGH,2
Who?,3
CONAN ,2
Me!,3
"Khalar turns to see the outline of Conan, framed by the moonlight, looking down at Khalar from atop of one the warrior statues.",1
"A thick vine dangles nearby, Conan's route down from the cave roof above.",1
Conan then leaps down to the skeleton covered floor before the altar.,1
It is a killing floor.,1
"The two Guardsmen leap for him, but Conan dispatches them with a pair of strikes.",1
Both fall down dead.,1
"Conan meets Tamara's eyes, a look of determination, assurance.",1
He starts toward the altar.,1
KHALAR SINGH,2
"I will say this for you, barbarian.",3
You are hard to kill.,3
CONAN,2
Let her go.,3
KHALAR SINGH,2
You've faced me before and lost.,3
What do you think has changed now?,3
CONAN,2
My purpose.,3
"Conan lunges for Khalar, their swords meeting with a flash of sparks.",1
"They fight to a brief standstill when ---THUMP, THUMP.",1
THE ALTAR,2
Tamara writhes in pain as the spikes drive deeper into her head.,1
More blood pours forth.,1
The blood in the channels speeds up and finds the channel leading down to the sacrificial pool.,1
"Conan makes another movement toward the altar, but Khalar nimbly blocks his path.",1
KHALAR SINGH,2
"You are strong, Cimmerian, but we both know you are not my equal.",3
Conan takes the burlap sack wrapped at his hip pulls it off.,1
CONAN,2
Once you used my father to teach your son a lesson about strength.,3
Now let me teach you.,3
Conan tosses out what is inside.,1
"It falls to the ground, rolling to Khalar Singh's feet.",1
FARIQ'S HEAD,2
"Khalar looks down at the ground -- at the head of his beloved son, his eyes gone, replaced by molten metal.",1
Khalar trembles in shock and rage.,1
KHALAR SINGH,2
No.,3
"Khalar reaches for the severed head, giving Conan a brief window to rush to Tamara's side.",1
"Conan tries to lift her off the altar, but the bone shackles still pin her down.",1
KHALAR SINGH,2
Cimmerian!!!,3
"Enraged, Khalar CHARGES Conan throwing all his skill and force into an all-out attack.",1
"Conan simply sidesteps it, then shatters the bone shackle holding one of Tamara's wrists.",1
"Before he can shatter the other, Khalar charges again.",1
"Khalar swings, Conan spins, his blade catching Khalar's just inches from his face.",1
"Conan throws Khalar off him, knocking the warlord back ten feet.",1
"Khalar's attack is feral, uncontrolled.",1
He's lost his balance.,1
"Spinning and striking blindly, Conan smashes the second shackle on her wrist.",1
"He continues his motion, bringing his sword around to meet Khalar's next strike.",1
"Now Khalar looks like the enraged amateur, and Conan the more polished warrior.",1
Their battle takes them away from the altar.,1
"With her hands free, Tamara struggles to pull the spikes out and remove the crown.",1
"THE KILLING FLOOR Conan repels another Khalar attack, this time striking Khalar's chest and drawing blood.",1
"The Guardsmen arrive from the other side of the cave, drawing their swords.",1
"Khalar waves them off, his fury aimed at the Cimmerian.",1
KHALAR SINGH,2
The Queen.,3
THE ALTAR,2
"In agony, Tamara pulls one of the spikes out, then another.",1
"She pushes with all her might, lifting the crown of iron off",1
"her bloodied head -- When the Guardsmen charge her, pin her down, and force the crown back on.",1
"THUMP, THUMP!",1
The crown spikes imbed themselves even deeper as Tamara SCREAMS.,1
The blood now fills the channels of the altar.,1
"WE FOLLOW the trail of blood, down the side of the altar, in a spiral channel around the leg, and in a wide circle around",1
the altar until reaching the channel's end -- THE FIRST DROP OF TAMARA'S BLOOD TOUCHES THE SACRIFICIAL POOL.,1
"It BOILS instantly, multiplying itself exponentially, bubbling forth and filling the entire pool.",1
AND ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.,1
A massive earthquake jolts the entire cave.,1
"THE KILLING FLOOR As Khalar Singh and Conan battle, the ground beneath them on the wide cave floor CRACKS and SPLINTERS.",1
THUMP-THUMP!,1
"The earthquake intensifies and the entire floor of the cave GIVES WAY, tumbling into an incredible abyss.",1
Conan and Khalar alike grab onto the only rocks they can reach to prevent them from falling further.,1
Conan ends up against one of the walls on the side of the cave.,1
Khalar clings to the rocks on the edge of the sacred pool.,1
Their bodies are illuminated by a fiery glow.,1
"They look below, searching for the source of the glow.",1
ACHERON,2
Another two hundred feet deep lies the golden spired city of ancient Acheron.,1
"The cave is but a forechamber, the slightest taste of the true glory and horror of Acheron.",1
"And as they stare down into the ancient city, the shadows there MOVE.",1
Is it a trick of the light?,1
No.,1
"Whatever the dark forms are, they are coming this way, climbing the tallest demonic spires and leaping impossibly far to climb up after Conan and Khalar Singh.",1
Khalar gazes down at the city with wide eyes.,1
KHALAR SINGH,2
THE ALTAR,2
"Tamara, her body's blood nearly drained, is still shackled to the altar, which now teeters over the edge of chasm, poised to fall into the fiery depths.",1
TAMARA,2
Shackle her!,3
Beyond my dreams -- Conan!!!,3
CONAN,2
"On the other side of the abyss, Conan spots her and scales the cave wall, up to a tiered plateau.",1
"He moves quickly, trying to get to Tamara.",1
KHALAR SINGH,2
"Khalar watches, entranced, as the first of the creatures rises out of the pit.",1
"They climb the walls like insects, clinging to the walls, their heads swiveling like a praying mantis.",1
ACHERONIAN WARRIORS,2
"The look like the statues above -- a hybrid -- part human, part demon.",1
"Their skin is a perfect black, armor carved of black bone, faces once human but now demonic with blood red eyes and gnashing teeth.",1
"They advance on Khalar Singh, who is furthest down now that Conan climbs upward towards Tamara.",1
KHALAR SINGH,2
(IN ACHERONIAN),4
"I am Khalar Singh, King of Acheron.",3
I command you to kneel!,3
"And this demonic horde advances right for him, their razor sharp teeth bared.",1
"Unsure, Khalar grips his tulwars tight.",1
"The demonic creatures draw close, and they -- kneel.",1
They climb out of the abyss and immediately lower their heads before Khalar Singh.,1
"Out of the corner of his eye, Khalar spots Conan, drawing near.",1
KHALAR SINGH,2
(IN ACHERONIAN),4
Show him the might of the army of Acheron!,3
But they do not rush to follow the order.,1
They stir.,1
One of them with more ornate bone armor than the rest looks over at Khalar's Guardsmen.,1
ACHERONIAN COMMANDER,2
(IN ACHERONIAN),4
"First, we feed.",3
Its voice is somewhere between a whisper and a hiss.,1
KHALAR SINGH,2
Fine.,3
Take your fill.,3
I will kill him myself.,3
CONAN,2
"Conan is on an intercept course with Tamara, leaping across chasms from statue to statue.",1
"Just below him, the first wave of Acheronian Warriors reach the Khalar's remaining Guardsmen.",1
KHALAR'S GUARDSMEN,2
"Khalar's Guardsmen, who have been watching the events with mouths agape, realize the danger too late.",1
The horde of Acheronian Warriors leaps on them and a massive battle ensues between the demonic warriors and the soldiers.,1
CONAN,2
"His climbing is dizzying, reminiscent of his youth scaling the cliffs of Cimmeria.",1
KHALAR,2
"Intercepts Conan just below the altar, his tulwars at the ready.",1
CONAN,2
Your story ends here.,3
"The two warriors square off, fighting even as they cling to the statues.",1
ACHERONIAN WARRIORS,2
"The demon warriors not only slay Khalar's Guardsmen, but rip their still living bodies apart, dousing themselves in the blood of their victims.",1
"It is a violent ritual, both Bacchantic and gruesome.",1
KHALAR,2
"Launches himself at Conan, his tulwars sparking off the stone statuary.",1
"Conan leaps to another statue, parrying the blows.",1
"Khalar overextends himself, and Conan's sword just barely misses his throat.",1
"Khalar pulls back, tries to settle himself.",1
"Conan's eyes narrow, he knows what Khalar is doing.",1
CONAN,2
"Like a woman, Fariq cried and begged me to spare him.",3
"Khalar ROARS in rage, launching an all-out offensive.",1
"Conan backs up slowly, waiting for his moment.",1
And it comes quickly.,1
Conan ducks below the tulwars and CUTS Khalar across the stomach.,1
"Khalar loses his balance and falls, one hand grabbing a protruding statue arm, dangling over the abyss.",1
Conan raises his sword to finish the job.,1
TAMARA ,2
Conan!!!,3
Conan glances down.,1
"The Acheronian Commander drank his fill, and now moves to the altar itself, his claw stroking Tamara's body.",1
"With one touch, the shackles open.",1
He and the Acheronian Warriors drag her pale body toward the abyss.,1
Khalar grins up at him through bloody teeth.,1
KHALAR SINGH,2
They take her to a place you can never follow.,3
"Who will you fail, Cimmerian?",3
Your father or your woman?,3
Conan leaps down to the altar.,1
The Acheronian Warriors attack.,1
"Standing atop the altar, Conan cuts down all comers, cutting his way through the enemy, working his way to Tamara.",1
CONAN,2
Tamara!!,3
"They leap on Conan, impossibly fast.",1
They stab him.,1
They cut him.,1
But he does not stop.,1
"Even wounded, he throws them into the abyss.",1
"And he reaches Tamara, just before the Commander drags her below.",1
He grabs her arm.,1
"The Commander grabs her other arm, baring his shark-like teeth.",1
BLAM!,1
Conan punches him in the mouth with his free hand and the Commander falls into the abyss.,1
The bloody Conan pulls Tamara up into his arms.,1
Only for Tamara to scream.,1
TAMARA,2
Conan!,3
Conan spins just in time as Khalar strikes.,1
"Khalar's tulwar narrowly misses, and Conan counters.",1
His father's sword runs Khalar Singh through.,1
Khalar's body falls into the abyss.,1
But the Acheronian Warriors surround them.,1
"Thousands climb out of the abyss, teeth bared, closing in on the wounded Conan.",1
"Tamara, badly weakened herself, grabs Conan.",1
TAMARA,2
"Conan, you know what you must do.",3
Kill me.,3
CONAN,2
No.,3
TAMARA,2
It is the only way to end this.,3
My death gives others life.,3
CONAN,2
I cannot.,3
TAMARA,2
You must.,3
Your parents both understood that purpose.,3
Now it is yours.,3
"Live, Conan.",3
A tear falls from Tamara's face.,1
The demonic warriors prepare to strike.,1
Conan drives his sword into Tamara's heart.,1
"The crown spikes retract and it falls from her head, tumbling into the abyss.",1
BOOM!,1
"A seismic explosion shakes everything, an unearthly GUST OF WIND pulling the Acheronian Warriors back down into the abyss.",1
ACHERONIAN CAVE,2

Conan places the torch to the pyre.,1
It quickly spreads.,1
