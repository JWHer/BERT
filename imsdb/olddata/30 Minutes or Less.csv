This is gonna come out of my paycheck,3
 You sure you don't want to take the moral high ground?,3
OTHER 15-YEAR-OLD,2
We'd rather take the pizzas,3

CHRISTOPHER,2
"Oh, yeah?",3
" 'Cause, I got some kids calling in saying you ripped them off",3
 Promised to buy them beer or something,3
WILL,2
"I actually did buy the beer, but it would have been illegal to give it to them, right?",3
 So I'm gonna do the responsible thing and drink it myself,3
CHRISTOPHER,2
That's real funny,3
 But I'm trying to run a business here,3
WILL,2
What kind of business promises to deliver anywhere in 30 minutes?,3
 It's ridiculous,3
CHRISTOPHER,2
I don't wanna hear another one of your bullshit excuses,3
 You're fired,3

   He looks over at a parked Hyundai Elantra,1
 A YOUNG MAN sits   in the passenger seat with a pensive look on his face,1
" He   makes a sudden, surprised gasp",1
 The homely YOUNG WOMAN who   was just blowing him sits up from his lap and rearranges   herself in the driver seat,1
 She leans over for a goodbye   kiss,1
 The Young Man obliges with much fanfare,1

 Putting your tongue in her mouth right after you fucked it,3

" May I offer you some alcohol, sir",3
 To wash the taste of yourself out of your mouth,3

" Chet takes a slug, gurgles for effect",3
CHET,2
"By the way, she said she had a friend",3

That's why I want to make you my partner,3
JAY,2
In what?,3
DWAYNE,2
In crime,3
 And business,3
" You see, it ain't just about the inheritance money",3
 It's about what I'm gonna do with it,3
Dwayne leans across the table,1
DWAYNE,2
I'm about to clue you in on something,3
 And then you'll understand the true magnitude of what's at stake here,3
 Are you ready?,3
JAY,2
Yes,3
 I'm totally ready,3
DWAYNE,2
Then answer me this,3
what's this town missing?,3
 I'll give you a hint,3
" It's a cash business, crawling with sexy bitches",3
JAY,2

A Chinese food restaurant?,3
DWAYNE,2
No,3
 A tanning salon,3

Think about it,3
 All that green,3
 All that brown flesh,3
"Jay nods, thinking about",1

DWAYNE,2
It's also the perfect front for a prostitution ring,3
JAY,2
"Yeah, of course",3
 Because of the booths,3
DWAYNE,2
Yes,3

It can all be ours,3

Jay looks conflicted,1
" Dwayne goes dark, like a spurned lover",1
DWAYNE,2
I'm starting to wonder if my dream book was wrong about you,3
 Maybe you sitting behind me doesn't mean you're my road dog,3
" Maybe it means you're plotting to stab me in the back, like some snake in the grass",3
JAY,2
That's crazy,3
 I'd never do something like that,3
 The dream book was right!,3
"Jay looks Dwayne in the eyes, knows it's all or nothing",1
JAY,2
Ok,3
 I'll do it,3
 But I'm not shooting him or anything,3
 I'll hold him while you shoot him,3
 That's it,3
Dwayne chuckles,1
DWAYNE,2
"Here's a fact: they don't build prisons for criminals, they build them for idiots",3
" Shit, they got three different types of CSI on TV, just laying out how the police do their business",3
"and still, idiots like you think you can just go out and do a murder yourself",3

"If you wanna be a millionaire, you gotta think like one",3
 And millionaires don't kill people,3
 They hire assassins,3
 Which I did,3
 We gotta pay him on Tuesday,3
JAY,2
What?,3
 Why would you do that?,3
DWAYNE,2
I was presented with an opportunity,3
 I took it,3
 100 thousand bucks for a highly trained assassin is a steal,3
JAY,2
But we don't have that kinda money,3
DWAYNE,2
Now we're addressing the real problem: how do we get the 100 grand?,3
" 'Cause once we get that, we get the million",3

DWAYNE (CONT'D),2
"And once we get the million, we will literally own this town and every single thing in it",3
JAY,2
I guess we could just,3
rob a bank,3
 One of these local banks with nothing but a dipshit security guard,3
DWAYNE,2
"Again, not quite thinking like a millionaire",3
JAY,2
"Okay, then let's hire someone to rob a bank",3
Dwayne thinks about this for a second,1
DWAYNE,2
"Fuck hiring them, we could just force someone to rob a bank for us",3
" Like with blackmail, or death threats, or -",3
JAY,2
(ALMOST INVOLUNTARILY),4
 A bomb,3
 Everyone's scared of a bomb,3
DWAYNE,2
I was gonna say hypnotism,3
but I like that,3
 It's out of the fucking box,3
" We just strap one to some motherfucker's chest, like we did to those watermelons",3
 Think you can you build some kinda bomb vest?,3
JAY,2
"Yeah, I mean",3
camel jockeys do it in caves,3
 I got a garage workshop,3
DWAYNE,2
I'm pretty sure this is exactly how a millionaire would do it,3
" And the beauty of it is: we don't lose any sleep, 'cause no one gets hurt",3
JAY,2
Except The Major,3
DWAYNE,2
Yeah,3

Dwayne smiles,1

DWAYNE,2
There's just one problem,3
 Where do we get our guy?,3
" 'Cause if we do a kidnapping, then we're right back where we started",3
doing shit that's gonna get us caught,3

 What we need is someone to come to us,3
to a place where we can control the situation,3
 Someone without any connection to us,3

 He's gay,3

I hope he chokes on a dick,3
 I never liked him,3
WILL,2
Your sister did,3
 She let him finger blast her,3
 Big time,3
Chet pauses the movie,1
CHET,2
What the fuck are you talking about?,3
 I don't want that shit in my head,3
WILL,2
Sorry,3
 Kate told me about it last night,3
 I thought you should know,3
CHET,2
You two were swapping stories about getting fingered?,3
 That's pretty cute,3
Chet chuckles,1
" Will ignores him, sips his beer",1
WILL,2
The point I'm trying to make is this: Tom Small was an asshole,3
 He was totally wrong for your sister,3

CHET,2
"You wanna apologize, don't you?",3
 You look like shit,3
 You've probably been up for days thinking about what an asshole you were,3
" Well, it's gonna take a lot more than some pathetic groveling -",3
WILL,2
(SUDDENLY),4
Chet!,3
 Shut up!,3
 I don't wanna apologize to you!,3
CHET,2
Then what do you want?,3
 Because we don't have anything left to say to each other,3
Will swallows hard,1
WILL,2
Here goes,3
 And this is gonna sound crazy,3
 Because it is fucking crazy,3
" But last night two guys in masks jumped me and strapped a bomb to my chest, and now I have less than eight hours to rob a bank",3
"Chet just stares at Will, unimpressed",1
CHET,2
You're hysterical,3
 Got me,3
 Great joke,3
 I'm going back to work now,3
Will steps in Chet's way,1

 He presses himself   flat against the wall,1
CHET,2

 What the fuck are you involved in?,3
 Terrorism?,3
WILL,2
"Chet, do you really think I'm a terrorist?",3
CHET,2
Yes!,3
 One of the dumb ones!,3
 The ones they convince to wear the bombs!,3

I am not fucking around here,3
 Two guys did this to me,3

CHET,2
And your first idea was to come to a school filled with young children?,3
WILL,2
I didn't -,3
CHET,2
Just back the fuck away from me with that thing,3
"Will backs all the way up, so that the guys are on opposite   ends of the classroom",1
WILL,2
"Listen, I think the vest is safe for now",3
 These guys don't want me to blow myself up on accident before I get their money,3
CHET,2
"Oh, so you figure the two psychopaths that rigged a bomb to your chest made sure it was safe?",3
 There's no margin for error in their fucking bomb vest design?,3

 All I do know is that this is real,3
 This is happening,3

CHET,2
For what?,3
WILL,2
"For help, Chet",3
 I need your help,3
 Please,3
 I can't do this alone,3
Chet looks Will over,1
 His desperation is palpable,1
" Chet   bites his lip, weighing the situation",1
CHET,2
Damn it!,3
 (takes a breath),4
" I'd like to tell you to get fucked, but you know what the problem is",1
I'm a better man than you,1
" And someday, I might actually forgive you",1
" So if I let you blow up, or whatever, that shit might come back and eat at my conscience, and totally affect my relationships with other people",1
 Like my wife and kids and shit,1
WILL,2
That's a,3
very rational way to look at the situation,3
(GENUINELY),4
"And you're right, about being a better guy than me",3
Chet takes a step toward Will,1
CHET,2
Are you sure that thing isn't gonna blow at any second?,3
Will just looks at Chet,1
unable to offer any assurance,1
   After a beat -,1
CHET,2
Could you just walk a few feet in front of me for a while?,3
WILL,2
I can do that,3

 Please,3
 I don't need you back seat driving me right now,3
CHET,2
Obviously,3
"Will stops, turns back toward Chet",1
WILL,2
"Just for the record, this isn't a nuclear weapon strapped to my chest",3
 And there are metal lockers on either side of the hallway,3
" If I fall, and if this thing goes off, I'm probably not taking out the whole school",3
CHET,2
Do you really want to debate this?,3
"Will sighs, turns back around",1

Your plan is probably better,3
 Just condescend me until I explode,3
Will goes to turn on the radio,1
 Chet grabs his hand,1
CHET,2
Maybe we should turn on the radio,3
 See if the signal sets the bomb off,3
 That would be an interesting experiment,3
Will heaves a frustrated sigh,1
 Chet eases up,1

Kate looks to the empty spot beside her where Will just was,1
"Flames inches from him, Vaughn lines up a desperate shot -",1
Good news: the bullet only grazes Jay's side,1
" Bad news: it   keeps going and punches through the flamethrower backpack,   which happens to be filled with gasoline, which happens to   have an incredibly low flash point",1
" So the spark from, say,   a bullet, would cause",1
AN ERUPTION OF FLAMES,1
"Meanwhile, Will pops up behind Chet and Kate, clutching the   garbage bag",1
WILL,2
I got the money,3
 Let's get the fuck out of here,3
They take off toward Will's car,1
Dwayne groggily comes to,1
"no SOUND, just a ringing",1
" The   first thing he sees: Vaughn storming toward him, god-knows-   what spewing from his mouth",1
 Vaughn levels his gun -,1
It doesn't make a sound for two reasons,1
 The second being   that it's out of bullets,1
Dwayne fumbles for his own hardware,1
 Muzzle flash,1

Vaughn drops to his knees,1
 Pulse snatched from him,1
SOUND SLAMS BACK to the tune of Jay's screams,1
" Dwayne looks   over to see his friend in flames, flailing his arms and   shrieking",1
" Dwayne's head snaps to the other side, where he   sees the Mustang's tires peel",1
" He tears off his mask,   frantically looks around",1
 The money is gone,1
DWAYNE,2
No!,3
"Jay disentangles himself from the backpack, the source of   the flames, but his clothes are now ablaze",1
" In his frenzy,   he somehow manages to string together two coherent words -",1
JAY,2
Dwayne!,3
 Help!,1
Dwayne gets to his feet as the Mustang roars down the   driveway,1
" He looks to Jay, then to his minivan",1
 Dwayne's   face: Two roads diverge in a wood,1
 Which to take?,1
DWAYNE,2
"Goddamn it, Jay!",3
"Dwayne sprints over to Jay, rips off his jacket and uses it   to beat the flames down",1
DWAYNE,2
"Stop, drop and roll!",3
Jay hits the deck,1
" Dwayne continues fighting the flames,   finally falls on top of Jay with the jacket spread and   smothers the last of them out",1
Jay looks up at Dwayne with puppy dog eyes,1
JAY,2
You came back for me,3
you said you never would,3
DWAYNE,2
"You didn't hesitate back there, Jay",3
 You did good,3
Jay smiles,1
 Flames overtake the field all around them,1
DWAYNE,2
I'm gonna go put a bullet in that motherfucker and get our money,3
 Think you can get outta here?,3
JAY,2
Yeah,3

That was the bomb I carried around all day,3
 I reactivated it and put it in the back of his van,3
 I guess his time was up,3
CHET,2

Nothing good if we stay in town and they pin this on us,3

 There's 100 grand in that trash bag by your feet,3

long red streaks,1
