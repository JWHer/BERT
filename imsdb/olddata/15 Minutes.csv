"  Eddie grips a half-smoked Cuban cigar, listening to Leon",1
LEON,2
"So, it looks to me - from the sixty-nine position - that they were doin' each other but were so whacked out of their heads they set the pipe on the mattress, lit it up, and they got fried",3
" What do you think, Eddie?",3
 Jordy enters - with Korfin who's carrying a paint can,1
EDDIE,2
I don't know,3
 We got the experts here,3
"  Show them what you found - I hope you don't mind, we came over to see if we could help",3
 Korfin makes a beeline for Eddie - wanting to meet the celebrity,1
KORFIN,2
"Nah, not at all",3
 Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin,3
 My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie,3
JORDY,2
Could you put out the cigar? Part of the job is picking up scents,3
EDDIE,2
"Oh, sure",3
 Eddie puts his cigar out,1
  Carefully slides it into a cigar holder and pockets it to finish later,1
LEON,2
"Well, I found - check it out - crack pipe",3
 Looks like they got careless,3
 Leon displays the pipe Emil found on the stairs,1

"Sorry, bro",3
JORDY,2
"Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine? It gives us somethin' to do",3

 You mind Leon?,3
LEON,2
No,3
 Go ahead,3

"So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?",3
LEON,2
That's what it looks like to me,3
JORDY,2
"And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other? You got to hand it to them",3
LEON,2
 realizes he's wrong - blows it  off,4

" Leon watches Jordy, quietly",1

 Don't wanna get your pants wet,3
 Leon and Eddie move to higher ground - on top of a burnt TV set,1
  Eddie hands the brushed bracelet to Leon,1
"  As Camello hacks at the floor with an ax, Jordy continues to examine the bodies and Korfin explains:",1
KORFIN,2
"They have not soot in their mouths, which means they weren't breathin' before the fire and that usually means they were deceased - and this piece of cloth that my partner found means they were wrapped up in something, probably doused with a flammable liquid and positioned like this on the bed",3
" To the untrained eye, it looks like an accident",3
" Jordy kicks around the draining floor, reaches down for something",1
LEON,2
What's he looking for?,3
EDDIE,2
A timer,3
" Jordy finds some wires attached to an outlet, pulls them up - on the other end is a timer",1

 MILOS' APARTMENT - DAWN,5
 CAMERA DESCENDS FROM THE SKY picking up Jordy as he enters what is left of Milos and Tamina's apartment,1
  The roof has been burned off,1
" He moves into the next room, trying to see through the darkness - looking through the muck and char",1
EDDIE,2
Okay to smoke?,3
" Jordy turns, surprised",1
  Eddie sits on a singed chair,1
"  He pours from a half-pint bottle of vodka into his 'won ton soup' container, smoking a cigar",1
  On the arm of the armchair is a brown legal folder and stacks of photographs of the crime scene and the burned bodies,1
JORDY,2
It's your crime scene now,3
 You can do what you want,3
EDDIE,2
Watch the news?,3
JORDY,2
"Nah, I musta missed it",3
EDDIE,2
"Well, just so you know",3
 I gave you guys the credit,3
JORDY,2
"Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff",3
EDDIE,2
"Nah, why should you?",3
JORDY,2
I don't even watch TV,3
EDDIE,2
Good,3
 Good,3
 Commendable,3
 Eddie knocks his 'won ton soup' back,1
JORDY,2
Did you get a report from the M,3
E,3
?,3
EDDIE,2
Sure,3
 But I would like to ask you something,3
 You got a problem with me?,3
JORDY,2
"If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too",3
  then,4
 What about the report?,3
EDDIE,2
"You were right, they were both dead before the fire",3
 The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine,3
 That's usually an indicator of something personal,3
 Jordy pulls out a sketch of Daphne,1
  Hands it to Eddie,1
JORDY,2
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here,3
EDDIE,2

 Jordy tries to take the sketch back,1
  Eddie holds on,1
EDDIE,2
What would you call her?,3
JORDY,2
"Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this",3
 I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead,3
  Maybe she saw something,3
 Maybe she was visiting somebody here,3
 Who knows?,3
 Eddie walks up to the burnt mattress - where the bodies were,1
EDDIE,2
Obviously they weren't having sex,3
 As you pointed out,3
 So why go through all the trouble of putting 'em like that?,3
 Eddie passes a crime scene photo of the bodies to Jordy,1
JORDY,2
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message,3
 Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe,3
 It could be to humiliate them,3
"  Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell",3
EDDIE,2
Eastern Europe,3
 Like what? Romania?  Hungary?,3
JORDY,2
Or Czechoslovakia,3
 The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years,3
 These are very intense people and they take things personally,3
 Eddie's cellular rings - he grabs it,1

Yeah? Where? You sure it was a knife?  Uh-huh,3

 Lots of blood,3
  He wouldn't walk out of here like that,3

 Murphy pulls out a clear plastic ruler and walks over to the blood-splattered wall,1
MURPHY,2
If you look here where he missed and hit the wall you see that the marks aren't deep but they're kinda wide,3
 not your everyday kitchen or pocket knife,3

 Better if it comes from you,3
DAPHNE,2

EDDIE,2
Arrest you for what? Why would we arrest you?,3
 She still hesitates,1
EDDIE (CONT'D),2

 I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work,3

  You're dead,3
JORDY,2
"I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent",3
EDDIE,2
"Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not",3
" Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional",3
JORDY,2
"But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody? I mean, you shoulda heard her there",3
 Tellin' her whole story,3
I believed her,3
EDDIE,2
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer,3
" Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer",3
 That's how you help her,3
  But you can't get involved in her like that,3
" You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case",3
 And lemme give you another piece of advice,3
 Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television,3
" And when you get out there, they know your face",3
" And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job",3
 And I get more done because of it,3
 Jordy studies Eddie for a quiet beat,1
JORDY,2
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief? Why'd you stand up for me like that?,3
EDDIE,2
"You know, I don't know",3
 I like you,3
  You remind me of a puppy I used to have,3
"  He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him",3
 Eddie picks up his cigar that's going out,1
  He sticks it in his mouth,1

 EDDIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT,5

EDDIE,2
It's Flemming,3
"anything turn up? Did they check the hospitals? Airports?  Yeah, I hit him! I fuckin' hit him! We should be all over everywhere - with dogs, choppers, everything! These guys are from fuckin' Czechoslovakia",3
 He looks at the flowers,1
  Decides to put the case behind him for a moment,1
EDDIE (CONT'D),2
I'll call you later,3
 He HANGS up,1
  Arranges the flowers in a vase,1
  So they look perfect,1
  Sets them on the coffee table,1
"  Fills out a card, writes, ""Nicky, I love you",1
"  Will you marry me?""  He sticks the card in the flowers - turns the lights down low",1
  Puts a romantic Sinatra song on the stereo,1
  Moves to the liquor cabinet,1
  Pours himself a drink,1
  He sets the ringbox on the coffee table - next to the flowers,1
  There's a knock at the door,1
EDDIE (CONT'D),2
Coming!,3
" Eddie smooths his hair, unlocks the door",1
  But the hallway is empty,1
EDDIE (CONT'D),2
Nicky!?!?,3
 No answer,1
  Eddie steps out in the hallway with the drink in his hand,1
  Walks toward the elevator,1
  Doesn't notice the shadow that passes behind him - entering his apartment,1
  Eddie turns,1
  No sign of anyone,1
EDDIE (CONT'D),2
Nicky?!,3
 He walks back toward his apartment,1
  Turns and locks the door,1
  A BLUR jumps out of the shadows SLAMMING him on the head with a gun,1
  Eddie tumbles to the floor!  OUT COLD!,1
 A BLURRED VIDEO IMAGE,1
 as it's focused - on Eddie - handcuffed and upper body taped to a chair - 20 minutes later - sobered up,1
  Emil is sitting in front of him,1
  On the coffee table alongside him are the flowers in a vase,1
  They've ransacked the place,1
"  Emil has Eddie's watch, his gold shield and his money",1
  He's smoking one of Eddie's cigars and in Emil's hand,1
is the diamond engagement ring and card,1
"  Oleg, 60 MINUTES-style, is positioned behind Emil videotaping Eddie",1
  He moves to the corner of the room - bringing a light back over to illuminate Eddie's face,1
EMIL,2
So,3
who's Nicky?,3
EDDIE,2
What do you want?,3
EMIL,2
Your opinion,3

" You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie",3
 And write books,3
EDDIE,2

 What's your accomplishment,3
EMIL,2
I kill someone famous,3
EDDIE,2
"Then do it, asshole",3
EMIL,2
Good - be tough to the end,3
 Actor who plays you will want to die like hero,3
 Eddie looks at the videocamera,1
  Emil answers Eddie's look,1
EMIL (CONT'D),2
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments,3
 They going to have real movie this time,3
EDDIE,2
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck,3
 Emil turns to Oleg,1
EMIL,2
Turn it off,3
 Oleg obeys,1
  Emil turns to Eddie,1
EMIL (CONT'D),2
No,3
 We are insane,3
 Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  gestures to Eddie,3
" So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital",3
  But what good is money there? Because once in hospital I say I not crazy,3
  Just pretended to be acquitted,3
 We see psychiatrists,3
 They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Eddie says nothing,3
 Oh - I got it,3
" Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice",3
" We come out free, rich and famous!",3
OLEG,2
Good idea!,3
EDDIE,2
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit? How fuckin' stupid are you?,3
EMIL,2
Smarter than Americans,3
 You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long,3
" Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me",3
  laughs,3
 So,3
"Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette?  Maybe you can propose to her now?",3
 Eddie says nothing,1
  Just stares at Emil,1
  Emil puffs on Eddie's cigar,1
EMIL (CONT'D),2
Okay,3
 He has nothing to say,3

OLEG (CONT'D),2
And,3

 Oleg FILMS as Emil raises Eddie's service revolver,1
"  Eddie suddenly KICKS at Emil's hand, but Emil pulls it away, backing out of Eddie's reach",1
EMIL,2
Bad last moment - I cut that out,3
 Emil raises the pistol again - pointing the gun at Eddie's left temple,1
"  Emil cocks the hammer, but Eddie avoids the gun, ducking his head to the side of Emil's arm",1
  Standing and following his head up Emil's arm and pushing him over into the desk,1
  Eddie then knocks Emil with the chair and Emil falls off the desk and onto the floor,1
 Oleg still grips the videocamera,1
  Eddie continues around with the chair and drives Oleg back across the room - pinning him to the wall,1
 Eddie comes back from Oleg to the gun at the same time as Emil is limping for it,1
  Eddie knocks Emil out of the way with the chair and then stabs him with the legs of the chair repeatedly,1
 Eddie comes up and around again at Oleg who is coming at him from the wall,1
  Eddie knocks Oleg over the coffee table and onto the sofa,1
"  Falling on top of him, rolling over and leaving Oleg on the sofa",1
 Eddie manages to get up from the sofa and position the chair in such a way that he can fall over backward and grab the gun,1
  Emil limps toward the gun at the same time and it is not clear in the darkness who has the gun,1
 Oleg gets up from the sofa and goes over to get the videocamera,1
  Eddie has managed to get the gun and comes up as Oleg is moving in with the camera and starts shooting toward Oleg - managing to shoot one of the blinds off the window and one of the lampshades off the lamp,1
 Oleg crouches down with the camera and Eddie starts to turn toward Emil who comes at him with the knife and stabs him in the stomach,1
" Emil steps back, revealing the knife is BURIED IN EDDIE'S STOMACH",1
" Eddie stumbles backward, falling over but still attached to the chair - holding the gun",1
  Eddie can't believe he got stabbed,1
  Blood swells around his stomach,1
  He can't be dying,1
  This can't be happening,1
  He looks at Emil,1
  The pain is terrible,1

  It's an enormous gathering - a sea of blue uniforms and dignitaries,1

TOMMY,2
I never got to tell him how much I admired him,3
HAWKINS,2
"I know, son, I know",3
 We all loved him,3
 Hawkins moves on,1
greeting others,1
  He notices at the end of the bar - sitting alone on a stool - is Nicolette,1
  He moves to her,1
  Pulls up a stool alongside her,1
"  She turns, looks at him",1
  Just stares at him for a long beat,1

NICOLETTE,2

 The crime guys found a card he'd written out to me,3
 And a ring box,3
these fuckers that killed him - have my ring,3
 They have my diamond engagement ring,3
 Hawkins touches her shoulder with compassion,1

"Well, he",3

HAWKINS,2
That morning,3
 He was talking to me and Leon about marriage,3
NICOLETTE,2
Oh my G-d,3
 We were having lunch here,3
  He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him,3
 I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!,3
 Nicolette is crying now,1
  She angrily wipes away a tear,1
NICOLETTE (CONT'D),2
I'd never had a great relationship before,3
 I'd never made great choices with men,3
 And he wasn't easy to get to know,3
" He was older, my parents told me I was nuts to get involved with him",3
  But he was so great to me,3
" Always encouraging, telling me I could do anything",3
  beat,3
 He was the one,3
" You know, I'd give up everything - everything - for just a little more time",3
 I would've spent fifteen minutes with him if that's all I knew I had,3

 The CAMERA WIDENS from the TV set,1
"  We are now in an interview room, a guard is posted outside the room",1
  Emil sits at a small table - with Cutler,1
  Emil is dressed in Bellevue clothes,1
  He's handcuffed and his ankle is bandaged,1
  Emil gives a complimentary nod toward Cutler,1
CUTLER,2
I brought you some letters,3
 It's really fan mail,3
 Women mostly,3
" One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check",3
  Another wants a check,3
EMIL,2
You bring the cigarettes?,3
CUTLER,2
"Oh, sure",3
" Cutler shakes a cigarette out of the pack, stuffs it in Emil's mouth and lights it for him",1
  Emil has never smoked before,1
CUTLER (CONT'D),2
"How're they treating you, alright  Emil is nonresponsive",3
 I want to get the cuffs off,3
 but there's a little bit of a problem,3
  Things out there are very negative right now for us,3
 We gotta change that around,3
" Perception is very, very important",3
 Perception is reality,3
 I know you're not fuckin' crazy,3
 But it's important that I get that message out,3
  Cause that's our only defense in this case,3
 Emil leans forward,1
  Cutler retrieves the cigarette from between his lips,1
CUTLER (CONT'D),2
I want you to focus on three things: fear,3
 He puts the cigarette back in Emil's mouth,1
CUTLER (CONT'D),2
delusions and paranoia,3
EMIL,2
I was all of these,3
CUTLER,2
"Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently",3
 No question about that,3
EMIL,2
What about Oleg?,3
CUTLER,2
Disappeared,3
 They're looking everywhere,3
 Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia,3
EMIL,2
"No, he is here",3
 Shit,3
CUTLER,2
Don't worry about him,3
 Think about yourself,3
EMIL,2
What about my movie rights? Book rights?,3
CUTLER,2
"Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing",3
EMIL,2
What's your cut? How much?,3
CUTLER,2
I would say,3
half,3
 Half is fair,3
EMIL,2
 laughs,3
 No,3
 No way,3
CUTLER,2
But it's,3
EMIL,2
Thirty-percent,3
 No more,3
 Or I call another lawyer,3
 This is the biggest case of your life,3
 Don't try to negotiate,3
 Thirty percent,3
 Say yes or no,3
CUTLER,2
"This is not about money, Emil",3
 I need your trust in me,3
EMIL,2
What else do you need?,3
CUTLER,2
I need to know about your background,3
 I need to know about your upbringing,3
 Why you're here,3
EMIL,2
 indicating cigarette,3
" Give me another one, please",3
 Cutler stuffs another cigarette in Emil's mouth,1
  Lights it,1
CUTLER,2
Tell me about yourself,3
 What you did as a young boy,3
 what your parents were like,3
EMIL,2
My father always degraded me,3
 Killed my self-esteem,3
 And my mother was blind,3
CUTLER,2
Your mother was blind?,3
EMIL,2
"Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me",3
  She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me,3
CUTLER,2
Back in the Czech Republic?,3
EMIL,2
"Yeah, yeah",3
bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind,3
 And my father blamed me for her blindness,3
CUTLER,2
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?,3
EMIL,2
"Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born",3
 Put it out,3
 Can you put the cigarette out?,3
 Cutler takes the cigarette from Emil's lips and extinguishes it,1
EMIL (CONT'D),2
That's what he did to me,3
 He put cigarettes out on me,3
CUTLER,2
Your father put cigarettes out on you?,3
EMIL,2
Out on my back when I was a small boy,3
CUTLER,2
Can I see your back?,3
 Emil rises,1
  Cutler comes around and pulls his shirt up,1
  HIS ENTIRE BACK IS COVERED WITH DISGUSTING PURPLISH WELTS FROM CIGARETTE BURNS,1
  Cutler recoils - horrified,1
CUTLER (CONT'D),2
"Oh, Jesus",3
EMIL,2
I'm abused,3
 Don't you think?,3
CUTLER,2

  Duffy has a subpoena in his hand,1
DUFFY,2
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image! This is going to be our Rodney King!,3
JORDY,2
What was I supposed to do? The guy tried to mug me,3
 I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot,3
DUFFY,2
Forgot? You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!,3
JORDY,2
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian,3
DUFFY,2
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine,3
JORDY,2
End my career?,3
DUFFY,2
"How are you going to fight this? Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight",3
 You'd have the good to weight against the bad!  It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do! Gimme your shield,3
JORDY,2
But Chief? Over this??,3
DUFFY,2
There's nothing to talk about,3
 Get a good lawyer,3
 You're suspended until your trial,3
 Jordy sighs,1
  Dying inside,1
  He surrenders his shield,1
"  Drops his handcuffs, his pager and his gun",1
  Duffy picks up the gun - looks at it,1
DUFFY (CONT'D),2

JORDY,2
But the D,3
A,3

STERN,2
They've got her testimony on videotape,3
  And even if they do take her to court immediately after she'll be extradited,3
  The Czechs want her back,3
" She shot a cop! I mean, Christ, man, what if Emil Slovak and Oleg Razgul fled to the Czech Republic? How would you feel if the Czechs wouldn't give them back to us?!",3
 Stern looks over at Daphne sitting in another office,1
  Lowers his voice,1
STERN (CONT'D),2
And just between us,3
I was married to a redhead,3
 They're a jinx,3
 Redheads are like cross-eyed priests,3
 Stay away from both,3
 Jordy gives him a look,1
STERN (CONT'D),2
You want to see her - go ahead,3

 HAWKINS,5
" and his camera crew, and, not far from him - frustrated and frazzled, waits Nicolette",1
"  Still grieving her loss, she looks over at Hawkins and his crew",1
  She shoots him a disgusted look - Hawkins shrugs it off,1
  He checks his watch - anxious - looks at his cameraman,1
HAWKINS,2
He said he'd be here,3
 Pick him up as he comes through the crowd,3
 Do you hear me? For Chrissakes don't miss this,3
 THE POLICE VAN PULLS UP,1
 Cutler's car behind it,1
  Emil - handcuffed - is unloaded from the van,1
"  Reporters swarm forward - Cutler gets out of his car, hurrying up, taking his place alongside Emil and the POLICE ESCORTS",1
  The swarm follows - firing questions at Cutler,1
  He answers the barrage of questions with:,1
CUTLER,2
"my client was suffering from a major illness of schizophrenic nature wherein during times of intense stress, as a result of paranoid and psychotic delusions - there was impairment of his ability to appreciate wrongfullness",3
 This is a victory for the mentally ill!,3
 Jordy walks alongside the moving mass,1
  His eyes focused on Emil - his hand in his pocket,1
"  We notice in the crowd Max, the celebrity-crazed pyromaniac",1
  What's he doing here?  Max's hand is also stuck deeply in his pocket,1
  A weird gleam in his eye,1
"  We see Korfin in the group, speaking to other cops",1
  Nicolette and her camera crew are vying for their place in the mass,1
  She watches Emil with quiet rage,1
  Cutler continues:,1
CUTLER (CONT'D),2
"before Emil boards the police boat and heads for Rykers Island where he will be checked into the psyche ward, I want to say one last word to you all",3
" As you know, Emil was coerced by Oleg Razgul into committing these murders, yet Oleg is still out in the street, a free man, filming gruesome murders",3
 My client and I hope he is brought to justice in the near future,3
" They are through the monuments, approaching the steps when Jordy passes a distracted Hawkins - who's checking his watch obsessively",1
HAWKINS,2
Where the hell is he? Goddamn it?!,3
 Jordy glares at Emil,1
"  Emil looks back at Jordy, gloating",1
  Smiles,1
  He won,1
  He beat the system,1
  Jordy suddenly erupts,1
JORDY,2
You think this is funny?? What the hell are you laughing at?,3
 Emil stares down Jordy,1
  Jordy grips the gun inside the jacket,1
CUTLER,2
 to a nearby escort,3
" Officer, keep this man back, he's assaulted my client on previous occasions",3
 A PATROLMAN blocks Jordy from Emil,1
JORDY,2
This is it? This bastard kills the best cop this city ever had and we do nothing?,3
CUTLER,2
"You may not like it marshal, but that's the law",3
JORDY,2
And what about the other victims?? What about their families? He'll end up in some country club nuthouse while his lawyer sells his rights to the movies and we just stand here and do nothing?  We let this scumbag walk?,3
 Jordy moves past the officer,1
  Emil breaks away from Cutler,1
