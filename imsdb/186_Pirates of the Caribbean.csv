"Standing besides him is GOVERNOR WEATHERBY SWAN, a man of obvious high station, brass buttons on his thick blue jacket.",1
He is Elizabeth's father.,1
NORRINGTON,2
That will do.,3
GIBBS,2
She was singing about pirates.,3
"Bad luck to sing about pirates, with us mired in this unnatural fog mark my words.",3

Captain Norrington...,3
"I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.",3

And that's what concerns me.,3

"A young boy, WILL TURNER, floating on his back in the otherwise empty water.",1
"There is nothing to show where he came from, or how he came to be there.",1
ELIZABETH,2
Look!,3
A boy!,3
In the water!,3

NORRINGTON,2
Man overboard!,3

(off Swan's look),4
Everyone's thinking it!,3
I'm just saying it!,3
Pirates!,3
SWAN,2
There is no proof of that.,3
It could have been an accident.,3
"Captain, these men were protection.",3
"If there is even the slightest chance one of those poor devils is still alive, we cannot abandon them!",3

SWAN,2
"Elizabeth, I want you to accompany the boy.",3

You'll watch over him?,3
Elizabeth nods gravely.,1
Swann hurries away to help unstow the longboat.,1
"The sailors lay the boy gently on the poop deck, behind the wheel, then hurry off.",1

My name is Elizabeth Swann.,3
WILL,2
Will Turner.,3
ELIZABETH,2
"I'm watching over you, Will.",3

His movement has opened the collar of his shirt; Elizabeth sees he wears a chain around his neck.,1
"She tugs it free, revealing-- A GOLD MEDALLION.",1
One side is blank.,1
She turns it over -- A SKULL gazes up at her.,1
"Vaguely Aztec in design, but to her eyes, it means one thing only:",1
ELIZABETH,2
You're a pirate.,3
She glances back at the crew.,1
"Sees Norrington, giving orders, moving toward her.",1
She looks back at Will comes to a quick decision.,1
Takes the medallion from around his neck.,1
Hides it under her coat.,1
Norrington arrives.,1
NORRINGTON,2
Did he speak?,3
ELIZABETH,2
His name is Will Turner that's all I found out.,3

Very good.,3
Norrington hurries off.,1
Elizabeth steals away to the stern of the ship.,1
Examines her prize the gold medallion.,1
"A wisp of wind, and she looks up -- Out over the sea, moving through the fog, silent as a ghost, is a large sailing ship, a schooner -- It has BLACK SAILS.",1
"Elizabeth stares, too frightened to move, or cry out.",1
The ship is obscured by the fog it as it passes but not the mizzen-top ... and there hangs the frightening skull and crossbones of the Jolly Roger.,1
Elizabeth looks from it to the medallion the skull on the flag is the same as the one on the medallion.,1
Fog surrounds and closes in on the black ship except for the black flag.,1
"As Elizabeth watches, the skull appears to TURN and GRIN at her -- Elizabeth shuts her eyes tight --",1
EIGHT YEARS LATER,2
INT.,5
GOVERNOR'S MANSION - ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM,5
"and then snap open again, startled wide with fear.",1
"But this is no longer twelve-year-old Elizabeth standing on the stern of the Dauntless; this is twenty-year-old Elizabeth, lying in bed in the dark.",1
"She remains motionless (were the images we just saw a nightmare, or a jumbled childhood memory?)",1
Elizabeth slowly looks as far out the corner of her eyes as possible without moving.,1
"Might there be someone in the room with her, looming over her?",1
"She turns, ready for anything.",1
She is alone.,1
"Elizabeth sits up, turns up the flame on an oil lamp besides the canopied bed.",1
"She carries the lamp across the room to a dressing table, sits down.",1
"She pulls one of the small drawers all the way out, reaches into a space beneath it and removes -- The MEDALLION.",1
She has kept it all this time.,1
It has not lost its luster or its sense of menace.,1
"She gazes at it as she absently returns the draw to its place -- A BOOMING knock on the door; Elizabeth jumps up, startled knocking over her chair.",1
SWANN,2
Elizabeth?,3
Is everything all right?,3
Are you decent?,3
ELIZABETH,2
Yes yes.,3
"She puts the medallion on, throws on a dressing gown as Swann enters, carrying a large box.",1
"A uniformed maid, ESTRELLA, follows.",1
SWANN,2
Still abed at this hour?,3
It's a beautiful day!,3
"Estrella pulls back the heavy curtains, revealing: Beneath a blue sky lies the bucolic town of PORT ROYAL, built on a natural harbor.",1
"On a bluff at the mouth of the harbor stands FORT CHARLES, its stone parapets lined with cannon.",1
SWANN,2
I have a gift for you.,3
"He opens the boxes, and displays for her a gorgeous velvet dress.",1
She lets out an admiring gasp.,1
ELIZABETH,2
It's beautiful.,3
May I inquire as to the occasion?,3
SWANN,2
Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?,3
"Elizabeth happily takes it, disappears behind a screened- off dressing area.",1
"Estrella follows, carrying the box.",1
SWANN,2
Although...I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.,3
ELIZABETH,2
Ceremony?,3
SWANN,2
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.,3
Elizabeth peeks around the screen.,1
ELIZABETH,2
I knew it.,3
SWANN,2
"Or, rather, Commodore Norrington...a fine gentleman, don't you think?",3
(no answer),4
"He fancies you, you know.",3
"Behind the screen, Elizabeth GASPS.",1
SWANN,2
Elizabeth?,3
How's it coming?,3
ON ELIZABETH -- She holds her hair and the medallion (still around her neck) out of the way as the maid cinches her into a corset over her slip.,1
Estrella has her foot in Elizabeth's back as she pulls the laces tight.,1
ELIZABETH,2
Difficult ... to say.,3
SWANN,2
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.,3
ELIZABETH,2
(holding her breath),4
Women in London must have learned to not breath.,3
Estrella is finished.,1
Elizabeth takes a breath and winces.,1
A butler appears in the doorway of the room.,1
BUTLER,2
Governor?,3
A caller is here for you.,3
INT.,5
GOVERNOR'S MANSION - FOYER,5
DAY,6
"The caller, dressed in rough clothing, stands in the foyer, looking very out of place, and knowing it.",1
He holds a long presentation case.,1
"He polishes the toes of his boots on the back of his calves, but it doesn't help.",1
SWANN,2
"Ah, Mr. Turner!",3
It's good to see you again!,3
The caller turns it is WILL TURNER.,1
"Handsome, with a watchful demeanor that gives him weight beyond his years.",1
WILL,2
"Good day, sir.",3
(holds out the case),4
I have your order.,3
"Swann hurries to him, opens the case.",1
Inside is a beautiful dress sword and scabbard.,1
Swann takes it out reverently.,1
WILL,2
WILL,2
The blade is folded steel.,3
That's gold filigree laid into the handle.,3
If I may -,3
"He takes the sword from Swann, and balances it on one finger at the point where the blade meets the guard.",1
WILL,2
Perfectly balanced.,3
The tang is nearly the full width of the blade..,3
SWANN,2
Impressive.,3
.. very impressive.,3
"Commodore Norrington will be pleased, I'm sure.",3
Do pass my compliments on to your master.,3
Will's face falls.,1
"Clearly, the work is his, and he is proud of it.",1
"With practiced ease, he flips the sword around, catches it by the hilt and returns it to the case.",1
WILL,2
(bows slightly),4
I shall.,3
A craftsman is always pleased to hear his work is appreciated --,3
"He stops speaking abruptly, staring past Swann - Elizabeth stands on the stairs.",1
"Granted, the dress may be painful to wear, but holy smokes!",1
SWANN,2
Elizabeth!,3
You look stunning!,3
"Will tries to speak, but can't.",1
"He gives up, smiles to himself, and simply nods emphatically.",1
ELIZABETH,2
Will!,3
It's so good to see you!,3
Her hand goes to the chain around her throat (the medallion is hidden in the bodice of her dress).,1
ELIZABETH,2
I dreamt about you last night.,3
"Will reacts with surprise: ""Really?",3
SWANN,2
"Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate -",3
ELIZABETH,2
(ignores her father),4
About the day we met.,3
Do you remember?,3
WILL,2
"I could never forget it, Miss Swann.",3
ELIZABETH,2
"Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?",3
WILL,2
"At least once more, Miss Swann.",3
As always.,3
Elizabeth is disappointed and a little hurt by his response.,1
SWANN,2
Well said!,3
There's a boy who understands propriety.,3
"Now, we must be going.",3
"Swann takes the case from Will, opens the door for Elizabeth.",1
"Elizabeth straightens her back, gathers her skirts and strides past Will.",1
ELIZABETH,2

IN THE CARRIAGE: Swann glowers at his daughter.,1
SWANN,2

"After all, it is only through his efforts that Port Royal has become at all civilized.",3
EXT.,5
PORT ROYAL - HARBOR,5
DAY,6
"The skeletal remains of four pirates, still clad in buccaneer rags, hang from gallows erected on a rocky promontory.",1
"There is a fifth, unoccupied gallows, bearing a sign:",1
PIRATES - YE BE WARNED.,5
The top of a billowing sail passes regally in front of them.,1
"On the landward face of the sail, apparently high in the rigging, is a man for whom the term 'swashbuckling rogue' was coined: Captain JACK SPARROW.",1
He gazes keen-eyed at the display as they pass.,1
Raises a tankard in salute.,1
"Suddenly, something below catches his attention.",1
"He jumps from the rigging and that's when we see that his is ship is not an imposing three-master, but just a small fishing dory with a single sail, plowing through the water the Jolly Mon.",1
And it leaks.,1
Which is why he has the tankard: to bail.,1
"Jack steps back to the tiller, and using a single sheet to control the sail, and the Jolly Mon comes around the promontory, the whole of Port Royal laid out before him.",1
"The huge British dreadnought, H.M.S.",1
Dauntless dominates the bay.,1
But Jack's attention is on a different ship: the H.M.S.,1
"Interceptor, a small sleek vessel with rail guns and a mortar in the middle of the main deck.",1
"It is tied up at the Navy landing, at the base of the cliffs below Fort Charles.",1
EXT.,5
PORT ROYAL - DOCKS,5
DAY,6
"Smoothly and with no wasted movement, Jack hauls down the sail, stows it, guides the dory alongside a dock.",1
"The HARBORMASTER, a long ledger tucked under his arm, is there to catch a line and help Jack tie up.",1
HARBORMASTER,2
"If you're out rolling scuppers in this tub, you're either incredibly brave or incredibly stupid.",3
JACK,2
It's remarkable how often those two traits coincide.,3
"He starts up the dock, strapping on his sword belt; besides the scabbard, it also carries a compass, pistol and small powder horn.",1
The Harbormaster cuts him off.,1
HARBORMASTER,2
"It's a shilling for the dock space, and you're going to have to give me your name.",3
JACK,2
"What do you say to three shillings, and we forget the name?",3
He tosses three shillings onto the ledger.,1
"The Harbormaster considers, then shuts the ledger on the coins, steps aside.",1
HARBORMASTER,2
"Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.",3
Jack gives him a half-salute as he goes past.,1
Looks across the water toward the Interceptor and smiles.,1
"Above the Interceptor, among the parapets of Fort Charles, a ceremony is underway -",1
EXT.,5
FORT CHARLES,5
DAY,6
"With choreographed precision, Swann removes the sword and scabbard from the presentation case, held by a uniformed Navy man.",1
"He slides the sword into the scabbard, holds it out vertically to Norrington, in full dress uniform.",1
"Norrington grasps the scabbard above Swann's hand, and Swann lets go.",1
"Norrington draws the sword, flourishes the sword, and snaps the blade up in front of his face.",1
"Swann steps forward, pins a medal to Norrington's jacket, steps back.",1
"Norrington nods, turns smartly and nods to his fellow officers, turns again and nods to the audience - dignitaries, merchants, plantation owners, their families.",1
"Another flourish, and he returns the sword to its scabbard.",1
The silence is broken by loud APPLAUSE.,1
Backslapping from the Navy men.,1
"In the audience, Elizabeth doesn't look so good, out beneath the hot sun.",1
"She applauds briefly, then winces.",1
"Discreetly tries to adjust the corset through the material of the dress, then resumes clapping, trying to hide her discomfort.",1
EXT.,5
PORT ROYAL - NAVY DOCK,5
DAY,6
"Two sailors on sentry duty, MURTOGG and MULLROY, take advantage of what little shade there is on the dock.",1
"But when Jack saunters up, they are immediately on alert.",1
MURTOGG,2
This dock is off-limits to civilians.,3
JACK,2
"Sorry, I didn't know.",3
Music drifts down from Fort Charles.,1
"Jack looks up, shields his eyes.",1
JACK,2
"Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?",3
You two weren't invited?,3
MURTOGG,2
No ... someone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.,3
JACK,2
This must be some important boat.,3
MULLROY,2
Ship.,3
JACK,2
Ship.,3
MURTOGG,2
Captain Norrington's made it his flagship.,3
He'll use it to hunt down the last dregs of piracy on the Spanish Lake.,3
MULLROY,2
Commodore.,3
MURTOGG,2
Right.,3
Commodore Norrington.,3
JACK,2
"That's a fine goal, I'm sure ...",3
But it seems to me a ship like that --,3
(indicates the Dauntless),4
makes this one here just a wee superfluous.,3
MURTOGG,2
"Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.",3
JACK,2
That so?,3
"I've heard of one, supposed to be fast, nigh uncatchable ... the Black Pearl?",3
Mullroy scoffs at the name.,1
MULLR0Y,2
There's no real ship as can match the Interceptor.,3
MURTOGG,2
The Black Pearl is a real ship.,3
MULLROY,2
"No, it's not.",3
MURTOGG,2
Yes it is.,3
I've seen it.,3
MULLR0Y,2
You've seen it?,3
MURTOGG,2
Yes.,3
MULLROY,2
You've seen the Black Pearl?,3
MURTOGG,2
Yes.,3
MULLR0Y,2
You haven't seen it.,3
MURTOGG,2
"Yes, I have.",3
MULLR0Y,2
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?,3
MURTOGG,2
... No .,3
MULLROY,2
No.,3
MURTOGG,2
But I've seen a ship with black sails.,3
MULLR0Y,2
"Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.",3
Is that what you're saying?,3
MURTOGG,2
... no.,3
MULLR0Y,2
(turns back to Jack),4
"Like I said, there's no real ship as can match -- Hey!",3
But Jack's not there.,1
"Murtogg and Mullroy look around, spot",1
-,0
"Jack standing at the wheel of the Interceptor, casually examining the mechanism.",1
MULLROY,2
You!,3
Jack looks over in exaggeratedly innocent surprise.,1
The sailors hurry toward the gangplank.,1
MULLROY,2
Get away from there!,3
You don't have permission to be aboard there!,3
Jack spreads his hands in apology.,1
JACK,2
I'm sorry.,3
It's just such a pretty boat.,3
Ship.,3
The sailors study him suspiciously.,1
MURTOGG,2
What's your name?,3
JACK,2
Smith.,3
MULLR0Y,2
"What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr.",3
Smith' ?,3
MURTOGG,2
And no lies!,3
JACK,2
None?,3
Very well.,3
You've rumbled me.,3
"I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go out on the account, do a little honest pirating.",3
MURTOGG,2
"I said, no lies.",3
MULLR0Y,2
I think he's telling the truth.,3
MURTOGG,2
He's not telling the truth.,3
MULLROY,2
He may be.,3
MURTOGG,2
If he were telling the truth he wouldn't have told us.,3
JACK,2
"Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn't believe the truth if he told it to you.",3
Murtogg and Mullroy consider that point --,1
EXT.,5
FORT CHARLES,5
DAY,6
"Elizabeth, pale and perspiring, fans herself weakly, oblivious to the music and chatter.",1
NORRINGTON,2
May I have a moment?,3
He extends his arm.,1
She takes it.,1
"He walks her away from the party, toward the parapet.",1
A rather too long of a silence as Norrington works up his courage.,1
NORRINGTON,2
(a burst),4
You look lovely.,3
Elizabeth.,3
"Elizabeth frowns, unable to focus.",1
Norrington mistakes her expression as disapproval.,1
NORRINGTON,2
I apologize if I seem forward but I must speak my mind.,3
NORRINGTON,2
(working up his,4
confidence to do so),4
This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career.,3
But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved.,3
The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman.,3
(beat),4
"You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.",3
ELIZABETH,2
I can't breathe.,3
NORRINGTON,2
(smiles),4
"I'm a bit nervous, myself --",3
"Elizabeth loses her balance, stumbles away from Norrington.",1
"She reaches a hand out to the parapet to steady herself, but it slides off and then she vanishes over the wall.",1
Gone.,1

"Jack reacts, pushes Murtogg aside to see - Elizabeth plummets from the top of the cliff.",1
"It seems to take her a long time to reach the sea -- Elizabeth hits the water, narrowly missing the sharp rocks.",1
"A wave breaks, and then she is washed out away from the cliff, struggling feebly.",1
"AT THE FORT, Norrington looks down --",1
NORRINGTON ELIZABETH!,5
"He leaps to the top of the parapet, prepared to dive a lieutenant, GILLETTE catches his arm.",1
GILLETTE,2
"The rocks, sir!",3
It's a miracle she missed them!,3
"Norrington shakes off his arm, looks down and realizes Gillette is right.",1
He jumps down and runs --,1

DAY,6
"Jack, Murtogg and Mullroy are still in shock from the sight.",1
JACK,2
Aren't you going to save her?,3
MULLR0Y,2
I can't swim.,3
Murtogg shakes his head neither does he.,1
JACK,2
(rolls his eyes),4
Sailors.,3
Above where Elizabeth struggles in the water.,1
Norrington and several other men pick their way down the cliffs.,1
They are too far away to get to her in time.,1
Jack scowls.,1
He has no choice and it pisses him off.,1
JACK,2
Fine.,3
"He pulls a pistol from his sword belt, hands it to Murtogg; then hands the belt to Mullroy.",1
JACK,2
Don't lose these.,3
"And then he dives into the water, swims toward Elizabeth.",1
"Elizabeth struggles to keep above water, gasping for air '- then a swell rolls over her, and she is submerged - UNDERWATER, Elizabeth drifts down, unconscious.",1
"The current turns her, and the MEDALLION slips loose from her bodice.",1

It is .,1
: far more difficult than it should be.,1
"He stops stroking, and they submerge.",1
UNDERWATER: Jack realizes that it is Elizabeth's heavy velvet dress that is weighing them down.,1
"He pulls at the buttons on the back, and they give way.",1
"He skins her out of the dress, and kicks away from it.",1
"The dress falls like a cloud into darkness - ON THE SURFACE: Jack swims with Elizabeth, much more quickly.",1
"AT THE DOCK, Murtogg and Mullroy are there to help haul Elizabeth out of the water.",1
"Jack climbs up, exhausted.",1
"Elizabeth is on her back; Murtogg holds her arms above her head, pumping them.",1
Mullroy puts his cheek to her nose and mouth.,1
MULLROY,2
Not breathing.,3
Murtogg looks down; it seems hopeless.,1
"Jack steps up, drawing Murtogg's knife from its sheath.",1
JACK,2
Move.,3
"He pushes past Mullroy, kneels over Elizabeth, raises the knife -- Murtogg is shocked - Jack slits the corset down the middle, yanks it away.",1
Elizabeth remains still.,1
"And then she coughs up water and gasps, choking on her first full breath.",1
Jack is relieved.,1
MULLROY,2
I never would have thought of that.,3
JACK,2
"Clearly, you've never been to Singapore.",3
Jack flips the knife and hands it hilt-first to Murtogg - and that's when he spots - The MEDALLION.,1
"Jack catches it up in his ""hand.",1
JACK,2
Where did you get this?,3
"Before Elizabeth can answer, the BLADE of a SWORD is at Jack's THROAT -- Norrington's new ceremonial sword, in fact, looking bright and sharp.",1
NORRINGTON,2
On your feet.,3
"It looks bad -- Jack standing over Elizabeth, most of her clothes gone.",1
He gets to his feet.,1
"The rest of Elizabeth's erstwhile rescuers reach the scene, including Swann.",1
SWANN,2
Elizabeth!,3
Are you all right?,3
"He strips off his jacket, drapes it around her.",1
ELIZABETH,2
"Yes yes, I'm fine Commodore Norrington, do you intend to kill my rescuer?",3
Norrington looks at Jack.,1
Jack nods as best he can with a blade beneath his chin.,1
"Norrington sheathes his sword, and extends his hand.",1
NORRINGTON,2
I believe thanks are in order.,3
Jack takes Norrington's hand gingerly.,1
"They shake and Norrington tightens his grip, yanks Jack's arm toward him, then tears back the sleeve of Jack's shirt exposing a BRAND on Jack's inner wrist: a large 'P.'",1
NORRINGTON,2
"Had a brush-up with the East India Trading Company, did you ... pirate?",3
"The others react in shock, but the sailors are well-trained in an instant, half a dozen pistols are aimed at Jack.",1
"He stands there, still holding the corset.",1
NORRINGTON,2
"Keep your guns on him, men.",3
"Gillette, fetch some irons.",3
Norrington notices something else below the 'P' brand is a tattoo: a small bird in flight across water.,1
NORRINGTON,2
"Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?",3
JACK,2
Captain Jack Sparrow.,3
If you please.,3
Norrington looks out at the bay.,1
NORRINGTON,2
I don't see your ship -- Captain.,3
MURTOGG,2
He said he'd come to commandeer one.,3
MULLROY,2
(to Murtogg),4
I told you he was telling the truth.,3
(currying favor),4
"These are his, sir.",3
He holds out Jack's pistol and belt.,1
"Norrington takes the pistol, examines it, notes the powder horn on Jack's belt.",1
NORRINGTON,2
(to Jack),4
"Extra powder, but no additional shot.",3
Jack shrugs.,1
"Norrington unhooks the compass from the belt, opens it.",1
He frowns at the reading.,1
"Moves the compass this way and that, keeping it parallel to the ground.",1
NORRINGTON,2
It doesn't bear true.,3
"Jack looks away, a bit embarrassed.",1
Norrington returns the compass to the belt.,1
Draws the sword half from the scabbard.,1
NORRINGTON,2
I half-expected it to be made of wood.,3
"He slides it back into the scabbard, hands it to Mullroy.",1
NORRINGTON,2
"Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship.",3
You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.,3
JACK,2
"Ah, but you have heard of me.",3
"Gillette returns with shackles, approaches Jack.",1
NORRINGTON,2
"Carefully, lieutenant.",3
Elizabeth steps forward.,1
Swann's jacket slips off her.,1
"She is unconcerned, but he is intent on putting it back on her.",1
ELIZABETH,2
"Commodore, I must protest.",3
"Pirate or not, this man saved my life.",3
NORRINGTON,2
One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.,3
Gillette snaps the manacles closed on Jack's wrists.,1
JACK,2
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.,3
NORRINGTON,2
(smiles),4
Indeed.,3
"Now that Jack is safely chained, Norrington nods to his men.",1
"All but one stow their weapons, and two step forward -",1
JACK,2
Finally.,3
"Lightning-quick, he snaps the corset around the hand and wrist of the man holding the pistol and yanks.",1
The pistol sails into the water.,1
"Before anyone can react to that, Jack has the manacle chain wrapped around Elizabeth's throat.",1
"Pistols are drawn again, but now Elizabeth serves as a shield.",1
Norrington raises a cautioning hand to his men.,1
JACK,2
"(backing away, toward land)",4
"Commodore Norrington ... my pistol and belt, please.",3
"Norrington hesitates, balls his fists in frustration.",1
JACK,2
Commodore!,3
Mullroy hands the pistol and belt to Norrington.,1
Norrington holds them out to Jack.,1
JACK,2
Elizabeth it is Elizabeth?,3
Elizabeth is more angry than frightened.,1
ELIZABETH Miss Swann.,1
JACK,2
"Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?",3
"She takes the belt and pistol from Norrington -- Jack's quicker than she is, and takes the pistol from her.",1
"He jerks her around so she is facing him, belly to belly.",1
JACK,2
"Now, if you'll be very kind?",3
She figures out what he wants: put the belt on him.,1
ELIZABETH,2
(as she works),4
You are despicable.,3
JACK,2
I saved your life; now you've saved mine.,3
We're square.,3
Done.,1
"He turns her again, and then backs up until he bumps against the cargo gantry.",1
JACK,2
Gentleman.,3
.. m' lady.,3
.. you will always remember this as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow.,3
"He shoves Elizabeth away, grabs a rope and pulls free a belaying pin a counterweight drops and Jack is lifted up to the middle of the gantry, where he grabs a second rope - Pistols fire and miss.",1
"Jack swings out, out, out, away and around from the gantry.",1
Norrington has held his shot.,1
"With careful aim, he tracks Jack's trajectory- Jack drops from the rope even as Norrington FIRES.",1
"His shot tears the rope as Jack plummets past one of the gantry's guy lines, he snaps the length of manacle chain over the line and grabs hold of the far loop slides down the line drops to the deck of a ship.",1
"He runs, leaping to another ship, then out of sight -",1
NORRINGTON,2
On his heels!,3
"Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort!",3
(to Elizabeth),4
"Elizabeth, are you -",3
ELIZABETH,2
"Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine!",3
Go capture him.,3
"Norrington's taken aback by her ire, and wisely hurries away.",1
Swann drapes his coat around Elizabeth.,1
SWANN,2
"Here, dear ... you should wear this.",3
"Elizabeth shivers, finding suddenly that she is cold.",1
Glances out at the bay where a THICK FOG moves across the top of the water.,1
She takes the jacket.,1
ELIZABETH,2
"Thank you, Father ... and let that be the last of your fashion advice, please.",3
But she accepts his comforting embrace.,1

PORT ROYAL - TOWN - ALLEY,5
DAY,6
"The fog creeps through, casting an eerie twilight pall.",1
An armed search party moves along the street.,1
They glance down an alley- On the far side is another search party.,1
"The men nod to each other, continue on.",1
"A moment, and then Jack drops from his hiding place beneath the eaves of a building.",1
He still wears the manacles.,1
"Across the street is a shop with barn doors, a pass-thru door set in the middle.",1
Above is a sign with a black anvil.,1
INT.,5
BLACKSMITH'S FORGE,5
DAY,6
"Jack slips in through the door, takes a look around: No windows.",1
"The forge is dark, lit by lanterns.",1
"Work-in- progress is scattered about: wagon wheels, wrought iron gates, pipes even a cannon with a crack in it.",1
But every tool is in place; the workbench is tidy and neat.,1
"Jack is startled by a noise: MISTER BROWN, in a blacksmith's apron, snores in the corner, cradling a bottle.",1
Jack gives him a hard poke.,1
Another.,1
"Brown snorts, turns away.",1
"Satisfied, Jack sheathes his sword, takes a short-handled sledge from its place on the wall.",1
Moves to the glowing coke furnace in the middle of the room.,1
"Slowly... he holds his right hand over the furnace, the chain down in the embers.",1
The chain begins to GLOW.,1
"Jack sweats, grimaces at the pain - Moving quickly, he wraps the chain around the nose of an anvil, brings the sledge down with a fast, hard stroke on the glowing links.",1
One SHATTERS.,1
"Jack drops the sledge, plunges his manacled hand in a bucket of water.",1
Steam billows.,1
"Jack pulls his hand out, flexes it.",1
Blisters form beneath the manacle but his hands are free.,1
The SOUND of the latch on the door -- Jack dives for cover.,1
"Will enters the forge, shuts the door behind him.",1
Spots the drunken Mister Brown in the corner.,1
WILL,2
Right where I left you.,3
Something catches his eye: an empty peg on the wall.,1
The sledge lying beside the anvil.,1
WILL,2
(under his breath),4
Not where I left you.,3
He moves casually toward the sledge.,1
Then grabs for it but the flat of a sword blade slaps his hand.,1
Will jumps back.,1
"Jack stands there, sword leveled at Will.",1
"He backs Will up, toward the door.",1
Will glares at him.,1
WILL,2
(voice low and tight),4
You're the one they're hunting.,3
The pirate.,3
"Jack acknowledges it with a tip of his head ... then frowns, regards Will.",1
JACK,2
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?,3
WILL,2
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.,3
JACK,2
Ah.,3
Then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record.,3
So if you'll excuse me ...,3
"Beside the door is a grindstone, a sword resting in the honing guide.",1
"Before Jack can react, Will has it in hand.",1
JACK,2
"Do you think this is wise, boy?",3
Crossing blades with a pirate?,3
WILL,2
You threatened Miss Swann.,3
JACK,2
Only a little.,3
"In response, Will assumes an en garde position.",1
"Jack appraises him, unhappy to see Will knows what he's doing.",1
Jack attacks.,1
"The two men stand in one place, trading feints, thrusts and parries with lightning speed, almost impossible to follow.",1
Will has no trouble matching Jack.,1
JACK,2
"You know what you're doing, I'll give you that ...",3
Excellent form ...,3
But how's your footwork?,3
If I step here -,3
He takes a step around an imaginary circle.,1
"Will steps the other way, maintaining his relationship to Jack.",1
JACK,2
Very good!,3
"And if I step again, you step again.",3
(continuing to step,4
around the circle),4
"And so we circle, circle, like dogs we circle.",3
They are now exactly opposite their initial positions.,1
JACK,2
Ta!,3
"Jack turns and heads for the door, now directly behind him.",1
"Will registers angry surprise and then with a vicious overhand motion, he throws his sword the sword buries itself into the door, just above the latch, barely missing Jack.",1
"Jack registers it, then pulls on the latch, but it won't move up the sword is in the way.",1
Jack rattles the latch.,1
Tugs on the sword a few times it is really stuck in there.,1
"Jack mouths a curse, but when he turns back to Will, he's smiling.",1
JACK,2
That's a good trick.,3
"Except, once again, you are between me and the way out.",3
(points his sword at the,4
back door),4
And now you have no weapon.,3
"Eyes on Jack, Will simply picks up a new sword from an anvil.",1
Jack slumps in dismay but then leaps forward.,1
Will and Jack duel.,1
Their blades flash and ring.,1
"Suddenly, Jack swings the chain still manacled to his left hand at Will's head.",1
"Will ducks it, comes up wide-eyed.",1
"Then Jack's chain smashes across Will's sword, disarming him.",1
Will quickly picks up another sword.,1
"Jack becomes aware that the entire room is filled with bladed weapons: swords, knives, boarding axes in various stages of completion.",1
JACK,2
Who makes all these?,3
WILL,2
I do.,3
And I practice with them.,3
At least three hours a day.,3
JACK,2
You need to find yourself a girl.,3
(Will sets his jaw),4
Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one but can't get her?,3
A direct hit and Will coils even more tightly with anger.,1
WILL,2
No.,3
I practice three hours a day so that when I meet a pirate ...,3
I can kill him.,3
"He explodes: kicks a rack, causing a sword to fall into his hand; uses his foot to bring his dropped sword into the air, catches it and attacks Jack, both blades flashing.",1
Jack parries with sword and chain.,1
"Jack's chain wraps around Will's sword; Will twists the handle of his guard through a link, and stabs the sword up into the ceiling - So Jack's manacled left arm is now suspended from the ceiling.",1
Not good.,1
"He parries using one hand, twisting and dodging around the furnace - Jack compresses the bellows, blowing a SHOWER OF SPARKS into Will's face.",1
"Jack grabs the chain, hoists himself up, kicks with his feet, knocking Will back.",1
"Jack uses his full weight, yanks the sword from the ceiling.",1
"Hurls a wooden mallet at Will, then a second, hitting Will on the wrist.",1
"Will drops his sword, falls down, gets up - Jack's pistol is aimed directly between Will's eyes.",1
"Will steps back, directly in front of the back exit.",1
"Glares, rubs his wrist gingerly.",1
WILL,2
You cheated.,3
JACK,2
(smiles; what do you expect?),4
Pirate.,3
Jack steps forward.,1
"Will steps back, fully blocking the door.",1
JACK,2
Move away.,3
WILL,2
No.,3
JACK,2
Move!,3
WILL,2
No.,3
I can not just step aside and let you escape.,3
Jack cocks the pistol.,1
Will stares back.,1
The stand-off lasts for a long moment.,1
JACK,2
"You're lucky, boy this shot's not meant for you.",3
Jack uncocks the pistol.,1
"Will is surprised, reassesses Jack",1

Jack crumples to the ground.,1

NORRINGTON,2
"Excellent work, Mister Brown.",3
You've aided in the capture of a dangerous fugitive.,3
BROWN,2
Just doing my civic duty.,3
Jack groans.,1
"Norrington stands over him, smiles.",1
NORRINGTON,2
I believe you will always remember this as the day Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped.,3

"She leans over the table, trying to recover.",1
The sound of running FOOTSTEPS gets louder ...,1
ELIZABETH,2
"Please, no ...",3
Elizabeth touches the chain of the medallion ... and a desperate idea occurs to her.,1
The pirates burst through the door.,1
"Elizabeth backs away, holds the bread knife out to ward them off.",1
"They come around either side of the table, stalking her -",1
ELIZABETH,2
(gasps it out),4
Par.,3
.. Parlay!,3
Pintel can't believe his ears.,1
PINTEL,2
What?,3
ELIZABETH,2
Parlay!,3
I invoke the right of parlay!,3
"According to"" the Code of the Brethren, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!",3
PINTEL,2
I know the code.,3
ELIZABETH,2
"If an adversary demands parley, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.",3
PINTEL,2
"It would appear, so do you.",3
SMOLDERING PIRATE,2
To blazes with the code!,3
"He steps forward, dirk drawn -- Pintel stops him.",1
PINTEL,2
"She wants to be taken to the Captain, and she'll go without a fuss.",3
He looks to Elizabeth: 'right?',1
Elizabeth nods.,1
PINTEL,2
We must honor the code.,3
"Smoldering Pirate concedes the point, sheaths his dirk.",1
He grabs Elizabeth roughly by the arm -,1

He spots the Governor's Mansion in the distance.,1
"There are FIGURES moving away from it -- Elizabeth, forced by the two pirates.",1
"Will hurries forward - Suddenly a PIRATE jumps out from the shadows, slashes; Will defends himself.",1
The pirate has one arm and wears a yellow bandana.,1
Will hesitates didn't he already kill this guy?,1
"The hesitation is just enough for another PIRATE, swinging a flaming torch, to SLAM Will in the head from behind.",1
Will crumples.,1
"The pirate lights a second torch, hands it to One-arm; they hoot with delight and head off, setting fires as they go.",1

FORT CHARLES - CELL BLOCK,5
NIGHT,6
The wall of the cells EXPLODES inward.,1
Jack pulls himself out from under rubble.,1
Moonlight spills in through the gaping hole created by the cannon ball.,1
Beyond it: freedom.,1
But it is centered on the other cell.,1
The part of Jack's cell that is gone is too small for a man to slip through.,1
PRISIONER,2
Praise be!,3
He and the other two scramble through.,1
PRISONER,2
(back to Jack),4
"My sympathies, friend you've no manner of luck at all!",3
"The three descend the rocks beyond, disappearing from view.",1
Jack is alone.,1
"Cannon fire continues, occasional hits shaking the fort.",1
"The dog cowers under a long bench, key ring still in his mouth.",1
"Jack sighs resigned, he picks up the bone from the other cell, and tries coax the dog forward.",1
JACK,2
"It's all right, doggie ... come here,",3
boy.,1
"Come here, Spot.",1
Rover.,1
Fido?,1
"To his surprise, the dog crawls out from under the bench.",1
Jack continues to coax him closer.,1
"The key ring is nearly within Jack's reach suddenly, the dog's attention goes to the door into the cell block.",1
"He BRISTLES, GROWLS.",1
"He backs away from the door, whining.",1
JACK,2
"What's the matter, boy?",3
"The dog bolts, through the bars, into the cell, then out through the breached wall taking the keys with him.",1
The door to the cell block bursts open.,1
A pair of pirates step in: KOEHLER and TWIGG.,1
TWIGG,2
This isn't the armory.,3
"He turns to go, but Koehler has spotted Jack.",1
KOEHLER,2
(Dutch accent),4
"Well, well... Look what we have here, Twigg.",3
It's.,3
Captain Sparrow.,3
TWIGG,2
Huh.,3
"Last time I saw you, you were all alone on a God-forsaken island, shrinking into the distance.",3
"I'd heard you'd gotten off, but I didn't believe it.",3
KOEHLER,2
Did you sprout little wings and flyaway?,3
TWIGG,2
His fortunes aren't improved much.,3
The two laugh.,1
Jack doesn't.,1
"He steps forward, close to the bars.",1
This puts him in a spill of moonlight.,1
He is tight with fury.,1
JACK,2
Worry about your own fortunes.,3
The lowest circle of hell is reserved for betrayers ... and mutineers.,3
Koehler and Twigg don't like hearing that.,1
"Koehler lashes out, grabs Jack by the throat through the bars.",1
"Jack clutches the pirate's wrist, looks down - Where they enter the moonlight, Koehler's wrists and hands are skeletal.",1
Jack's eyes go wide he is holding a skeleton arm.,1
JACK,2
You are cursed.,3
"Koehler sneers, shoves Jack backwards, hard.",1
"Now out of the moonlight, his hand is normal.",1
"Jack stares, realizing -",1
JACK,2
The stories are true.,3
Koehler ushers Twigg toward the door.,1
Looks back.,1
KOEHLER,2
You know nothing of hell.,3
And then they're gone.,1

Elizabeth sits in the prow.,1
Columns of water from cannon balls geyser up around the boat.,1
The fog parts.,1
"Elizabeth looks up to see -- The Black Pearl, a tall galleon, its black sails looming high above her.",1
"At the bow is an ornately carved figurehead of a beautiful woman, arm held high, a small bird taking wing from her outstretched hand.",1
The longboat makes for a pair of lines dangling from a winch.,1

NIGHT,6
Lit by lanterns; no moon is visible beneath the fog.,1
Smoke hangs heavy above the deck.,1
"Elizabeth's longboat is raised above the deck rail pirates spot her, and stare.",1
One polite fellow steps forward to offer his hand.,1
She takes it and steps down.,1
"She huddles, self-conscious in her nightgown and dressing robe.",1
BOSUN,2
I didn't know we was taking captives.,3
PINTEL,2
She's invoked the right of parlay... with Captain Barbossa.,3
"ON THE POOP DECK an imposing FIGURE in silhouette stands by the wheel, too far away to have heard Pintel's words.",1
But his head turns at the mention of his name.,1
The silhouetted figure moves toward the stairs.,1
"A cloud of SMOKE obscures him and then, as if he skipped the stairs, he strides out of the SMOKE on the main deck- This is BARBOSSA.",1
"Despite the bright colors of clothing, definitely not a man you'd want to meet in a dark alley or anywhere, for that matter.",1
"Elizabeth, more terrified than ever, cannot look away from his eyes.",1
But she musters her courage -,1
ELIZABETH,2
I am here to --,3
The Bosun SLAPS her.,1
BOSUN,2
You'll speak when spoken to!,3
His wrist is grabbed painfully by Barbossa.,1
BARBOSSA,2
And you'll not lay a hand on those under the protection of parlay!,3
BOSUN,2
"Aye, sir.",3
Barbossa releases him.,1
"Turns to Elizabeth, smiles it shows both silver and gold teeth.",1
BARBOSSA,2
"My apologies, miss.",3
"As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?",3
ELIZABETH,2
Captain Barbossa ...,3
I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.,3
Barbossa is both impressed and amused.,1
BARBOSSA,2
"There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.",3
What is it you want?,3
ELIZABETH,2
I want you to leave.,3
And never come back.,3
Barbossa and the pirates laugh.,1
BARBOSSA,2
I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.,3
(helpfully),4
Means' No. ',3
ELIZABETH,2
Very well.,3
"She quickly slips the medallion off, darts to the side rail, dangles it over the side of the ship.",1
The pirates go quiet.,1
ELIZABETH,2
I'll drop it!,3
BARBOSSA,2
My holds are bursting with swag.,3
That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?,3
ELIZABETH,2
Because it's what you're searching for.,3
You've been searching for it for years.,3
I recognize this ship.,3
"I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.",3
BARBOSSA,2
(interested),4
"Did you, now?",3
Elizabeth glares at him.,1
She's getting nowhere.,1
ELIZABETH,2
Fine.,3
"I suppose if this is worthless, there's no reason to keep it.",3
"She flips the medallion up, off her finger -",1
BARBOSSA,2
NO!,3
"She catches it by the chain, smiles at him triumphantly.",1
BARBOSSA,2
"You have a name, missy?",3
ELIZABETH,2
Elizabeth -,3
(stops herself from,4
"saying ""Swann""; then:)",4
Turner.,3
(embroidering),4
I'm a maid in the governor's household.,3
(curtsies),4
Barbossa reacts to the name Turner: it confirms what he has suspected.,3
The other pirates surreptitiously exchange glances and nods.,3
BARBOSSA,2
"You've got sand, for a maid.",3
ELIZABETH,2
(curtsies again),4
"Thank you, sir.",3
BARBOSSA,2
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?,3
"A family heirloom, perhaps?",3
ELIZABETH,2
Of course.,3
(offended),4
"I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.",3
BARBOSSA,2
"No, no, nothing like that.",3
(comes to a decision),4
Very well.,3
"You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.",3
ELIZABETH,2
Can I trust you?,3
BARBOSSA,2
It's you who invoked the parlay!,3
"Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand it over, now... or these be the last friendly words you'll hear!",3
"Elizabeth hesitates, but she has no choice.",1
She holds out the medallion.,1
"He grabs it, clutches it in his fist like hope.",1
ELIZABETH,2
Our bargain.,3
?,3
Barbossa grins devilishly but then nods to the Bosun.,1
BOSUN,2
"Still the guns, and stow 'em!",3
"Signal the men, set the flags, and make good to clear port!",3
"For the first time since the attack began, the BOOMING of the guns ceases.",1
Elizabeth is surprised and relieved.,1
The pirates hustle to follow orders.,1
Barbossa turns away.,1
ELIZABETH,2
Wait!,3
You must return me to shore!,3
According to the rules of the Order of the Brethren -,3
Barbossa wheels on her.,1
BARBOSSA,2
First.,3
"Your return to shore was not part of our negotiations nor our agreement, and so I 'must' do nothing.",3
Secondly: you must be a pirate for the pirate's code to apply.,3
And you're not.,3
And thirdly...,3
the code is more what you'd call guidelines than actual rules.,1

WILL,2
They've taken her!,3
They've taken Elizabeth!,3
"A group stares at him: Swann, Norrington, and Gillette among others, gathered around a map.",1
"The map is so large it drapes over the Governor's desk, the far end supported by a chair.",1
NORRINGTON,2
We're aware of the situation.,3
WILL,2
We have to hunt them down and save her!,3
Swann's worry has made him short-tempered.,1
SWANN,2
Where do you propose we start?,3
"If you have any information that concerns my daughter, then share it!",3
"If anyone does, tell me!",3
(Will is silent),4
"Leave, Mr. Turner.",3
Murtogg has remembered something.,1
He ventures it warily:,1
MURTOGG,2
That Jack Sparrow... he talked about the Black Pearl.,3
MULLROY,2
"Mentioned it, is more what he did.",3
MURTOGG,2
Still --,3
WILL,2
We can ask him where it is maybe he can lead us to it!,3
SWANN,2
That pirate tried to kill my daughter.,3
We could never trust a word he said!,3
WILL,2
We could strike a bargain -,3
NORRINGTON,2
No.,3
The pirates who invaded this fort left Sparrow locked in his cell.,3
"Ergo, he is not their ally, and therefore of no value.",3
(through with Will),4
"We will determine their most likely course, and launch a search mission that sails with the tide.",3
"Will slams the boarding axe into the desk, through the map.",1
WILL,2
That's not good enough.,3
This is Elizabeth's life!,3
"Norrington is quick to react; he throws a strong arm across Will's back, and guides him roughly to the door.",1
NORRINGTON,2
"Mr. Turner, this is not the time for rash actions.",3
(low),4
Do not make the mistake of thinking you are the only man here who loves Elizabeth.,3

Looks around.,1
"Jack lounges on the floor of his cell, apparently relaxed and unconcerned.",1
Will marches straight up to the bars.,1
WILL,2
Are you familiar with that ship?,3
The Black Pearl?,3
JACK,2
Somewhat.,3
WILL,2
Where does it make berth?,3
JACK,2
Surely you've heard the stories?,3
The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta... an island that cannot be found except by those who already know where it is.,3
WILL,2
The ship's real enough.,3
So its anchorage must be a real place.,3
Where is it?,3
JACK,2
Why ask me?,3
WILL,2
Because you're a pirate.,3
JACK,2
And you want to turn pirate yourself?,3
WILL,2
Never.,3
(beat),4
They took Miss Swann.,3
JACK,2
(he was right),4
So it is that you found a girl.,3
"Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone.",3
I see no profit in it for me.,3
Will slams his fist against the bars in frustration.,1
Jack is surprised at the outburst.,1
Will thinks ... makes a decision.,1
WILL,2
I can get you out of here.,3
JACK,2
How?,3
The key's run off.,3
WILL,2
(examines the cell),4
I helped build these cells.,3
Those are hook-and-ring hinges.,3
"The proper application of strength, the door'll lift free.",3
Just calls for the right lever and fulcrum.,3
"Jack watches Will as he speaks, and it dawns on him -- Will is the spitting image of someone he's known in the past.",1
JACK,2
Your name is Turner.,3
Will gives him a puzzled look.,1
WILL,2
Yes.,3
Will Turner.,3
Jack grins.,1
JACK,2
Will Turner...,3
(he stands),4
"I'll tell you what, Mr. Turner.",3
I've changed my mind.,3
"You spring me from this cell, and on pain of death, I'll you to the Black Pearl.",3
(sticks out his hand),4
Do we have an accord?,3
Will gives him a suspicious look.,1
The deal seems too good.,1
"Jack keeps his hand out, still smiling.",1
Will shakes it.,1
WILL,2
Agreed.,3
JACK,2
Agreed!,3
"Will looks around, figures out what he needs.",1
"He makes a chair his fulcrum, and levers the long bench under the door.",1
"Pushes down it's hard work but the cell door rises, and then falls forward, CRASHING down on the bench and chair.",1
Jack is impressed.,1
He steps out of the cell.,1
WILL,2
Someone will have heard that.,3
Hurry.,3
Will heads for the door.,1
"Jack searches the desk, cupboards.",1
JACK,2
Not without my effects.,3
WILL,2
We need to go!,3
"Jack finds his pistol, sword belt, and compass.",1
"Straps on the belt, checks the shot in his pistol.",1
WILL,2
Why are you bothering with that?,3
JACK,2
"My business, Will.",3
"As for your business -one question, or there's no use going.",3
(joins Will at the door),4
This girl what does she mean to you?,3
How far are you willing to go to save her?,3
WILL,2

Jack hops down into the boat.,1
Prepares to make way.,1
JACK,2
I knew the Harbormaster wouldn't report her.,3
"Honest men are slaves to their conscience, and there's no predicting 'em.",3
But you can always trust a dishonest man to stay that way...,3
"Jack notices that Will is standing, frozen on the dock, staring at the boat in dismay.",1
JACK,2
Come aboard.,3
WILL,2
"I haven't set foot off dry land I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.",3
(regards the boat),4
It's been a sound policy.,3
JACK,2
No worries there.,3
She's far more likely to rot out from under us.,3
"Will steels himself, steps into the boat as if its going to capsize with the slightest movement.",1
Jack hoists the sail.,1
JACK,2
"Besides, we are about to better our prospects considerably.",3
He nods toward the H.M.S.,1
"Dauntless, looming in the harbor.",1
Will whiteknuckles the gunwales.,1
WILL,2
We're going to steal a ship?,3
That ship?,3
JACK,2
Commandeer.,3
We're going to commandeer a ship.,3
Nautical term.,3
WILL,2
It's still against the law.,3
JACK,2
So's breaking a man out of jail.,3

You're serious about this.,3

You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.,3
You'll never make it out of the bay.,3

Fine by me.,3

How do we expect to find an island no one can find with a compass that doesn't work?,3
GIBBS,2
"Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.",3

He never told me that.,3

"See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England.",3
Somehow I he came by the money to commission the Pearl.,3

JACK,2
The pistol.,3
"When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot.",3
"No good for hunting, or surviving, really.",3
But after three weeks of starvation and thirst the option of that pistol begins to look good.,3
Jack lets this sink in.,1

Anything else?,3
WILL,2
And Jack.,3
And the crew.,3
Free and unharmed.,3
I f you agree... then...,3
I will remain with you.,3
Barbossa considers; his crew waits.,1
Finally -,1
BARBOSSA,2
Agreed.,3
"You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune -",3
ELIZABETH,2
Will you can't trust him.,3
WILL,2
You must swear by the Holy Bible.,3
BARBOSSA,2
Eh?,3
"You have my word, then on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.",3
"Barbossa crosses himself, as do many of his men.",1
Will lowers the gun ... steps down the pirates surround him.,1

Look there.,3
That's the very same island we made Jack governor of on our last trip.,3

A CHEER goes up from the pirates.,1

WILL,2
No!,3

BARBOSSA,2

No good can come of it.,3

"Now, Jack.",3
That reef is less than a league distant.,3
"It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.",3

"By the Powers, you're right!",3

Where's Jack's pistol?,3
Who's got it?,3
Bring it forward!,3
JACK,2
"A gentleman might give us two pistols, seeing as there are two of us, this time.",3
A pirate hands Jack's pistol to Barbossa.,1
BARBOSSA,2
Tell you what.,3
"I'll give you one pistol, and let you be the gentleman, an' shoot the lady, and starve to death yourself!",3
(grins),4
"That is, presuming you're not both drownded.",3
The pirates laugh.,1
"Barbossa tosses Jack the pistol but over his head, and down into the water with a splash.",1
BARBOSSA,2
"So how did you get off that island, anyway?",3
JACK,2
You can go to your grave not knowing.,3
BARBOSSA,2
That's fair.,3
Jack glares at Barbossa.,1
"Then he's prodded with a cutlass, takes a step out.",1
Reaches the end of the plank steps off.,1
Jack plunges down into the water.,1

She throws it at him.,1
ELIZABETH,2
Here it will go well with your black heart !,3
Barbossa indicates the plank.,1
ELIZABETH,2
I will not walk into the ocean.,3
You'll have to throw me in!,3

You went back for that?,3
We need to head for the reef!,3
She starts swimming.,1
Jack hesitates.,1

Jack lays on the beach.,1
"He has dismantled his pistol; the parts, ball and powder dry on his scarf.",1
ELIZABETH,2
Has it changed since the last time you were here?,3
JACK,2
The trees are taller.,3
Jack checks to see if the pistol parts are dry; they are.,1
He sets about re-assembling and loading his pistol.,1
ELIZABETH,2
I hope you have no intention of using that.,3
Jack has finished putting his pistol back together.,1
"He shoves it in his belt, walks off.",1
JACK,2
Not yet.,3
Ask me again in a few weeks.,3
Elizabeth can't believe it.,1
ELIZABETH,2
Captain Sparrow!,3
We have to get off this island immediately!,3
JACK,2
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.,3
He climbs up toward a clump of palm trees.,1
Digs for something beneath the sand.,1
He finds it: a large iron ring.,1
ELIZABETH,2
What is that?,3
Is there a boat under there?,3
"Jack heaves the trap door up and over, revealing a pit.",1
"Inside are barrels and bottles of rum ... all covered with dust and cobwebs, long abandoned.",1
Jack's face falls.,1
ELIZABETH,2
What?,3
What's wrong?,3
How will this help us get off the island?,3
JACK,2
It won't.,3
"It won't, and so we won't.",3
"He jumps down into the pit, cracks open a bottle of rum,.",1
takes a swig.,1
ELIZABETH,2
But ... you did it before!,3
Last time -,3
JACK,2
"Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.",3
"Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.",3
JACK,2
"But from the looks of this, they've long been'out of business, and so that won't be happening again.",3
(takes another swig),4
We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.,3
ELIZABETH,2
So that's it?,3
That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?,3
You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?,3
JACK,2
"Welcome to the Caribbean, love.",3
"He gathers up a few bottles, heads for the beach.",1
JACK,2
"You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord.",3
"We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again.",3
"And we've got rum, praise the Lord.",3
"We can stay alive a month, maybe more.",3
"Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.",3
ELIZABETH,2
A month?,3
Will doesn't have a month!,3
We've got to do something to help him!,3
JACK,2
You're right.,3
(hoists the bottle),4
"Here's luck to you, Will Turner.",3
He drinks and defiantly returns Elizabeth's angry gaze.,1
"But then turns away, sits down.",1
JACK,2
"Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth.",3
But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.,3
ELIZABETH,2
"Not when you can drink instead, at least.",3
Jack tosses her a bottle.,1
JACK,2
Try it.,3
"It goes down rough, but it goes down and the second swig goes down easier.",3
Elizabeth considers.,1
Comes to a decision.,1
"She unseals the bottle, takes a swig.",1
They sit in silence for a bit.,1
ELIZABETH,2
And you will call me Miss Swann.,3
Jack toasts her: you got it.,1
Elizabeth studies her bottle... gives Jack a sidelong glance.,1

"Please,",3
ELIZABETH,2
Nothing ... it's nothing.,3
Just ...,3
I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.,3
A song about pirates.,3
JACK,2
"I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.",3
Let's hear it.,3
ELIZABETH,2
"Oh, no ... it's silly.",3
"Back in England we didn't know a thing about pirates, really.",3
They seemed so romantic and daring -,3
Jack likes the way that sounds.,1
ELIZABETH,2
(looks at him),4
"That was before I met one, of course.",3
JACK,2
Now I must hear this song.,3
An authentic pirate song.,3
Have at it.,3
ELIZABETH,2
"Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...",3
JACK,2
More to drink!,3
"He gathers two more bottles, tosses one to her.",1
She drops her half-finished bottle to catch it.,1
"Opens it, takes a sip.",1
JACK,2
Well?,3
"Elizabeth clears her throat, begins to sing self- consciously, becoming stronger as she goes on.",1
ELIZABETH,2
"We pillage, we plunder, we rifle, we loot, Drink up me hearties, yo ho.",3

Irish ballad),4
Aye but we're loved by our mums and our dads.,3
"Drink up me hearties, yo ho!",3
"They hoist their bottles, but only Jack drinks.",1
"He drains the bottle, then tosses it away.",1
JACK,2
"When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!",3
ELIZABETH,2
You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.,3
Elizabeth salutes the idea with her bottle.,1
Jack doesn't have a bottle to salute back.,1
She hands him hers.,1
"He drinks, then settles shakily to the ground.",1
Elizabeth sits beside him.,1
JACK,2
Not just the Spanish Main.,3
The whole ocean.,3

"Wherever we want to go, we go.",3
"That's what a ship is, you know.",3
Not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails.,3
That's what a ship need_ ... but what a ship is what the Black Pearl really-is ... is freedom.,3
Elizabeth lays her head on his shoulder.,1

"Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.",3

Mr. Sparrow!,3

"Yes, the rum is gone.",3
She wipes her hands together.,1
One of the rum barrels in the fire EXPLODES.,1

Why?,3
ELIZABETH,2
"One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels.",3
Two -,3
She points to the sky.,1

"That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction.",3
The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me do you think there is even a chance they could mass it?,3

But so was his decision to engage in piracy.,3

"Commodore, please!",3
JACK,2
"Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.",3
How can you pass that up?,3
NORRINGTON,2
"By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.",3

"Commodore, I beg you please do this ... for me.",3
As a wedding gift.,3

I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?,3

You may seclude yourself in my cabin.,3

That would hardly be proper.,3

Stupid blighter.,3
"He threw in with us after we relieved Jack Sparrow of his captaincy, but turned out, it never sat well with him- particularly after we found Cortes' treasure, and its peculiar condition.",3
"He thought we deserved to be cursed, for leaving ol' Jack to the fate we did.",3
"That's why he sent off a piece of the treasure to you, as it were: so it would never be recovered, and so cursed we_ remain.",3
WILL,2
And then he ran.,3
And he's hiding out someplace where you haven't been able to find him.,3
PINTEL,2
"That's a nice thought, to be sure, and I wager your da wishes he'd thought it hisself.",3
"But, no.",3

"Jack leads Will out of a narrow passage and stops, staring.",1
Will is a few steps behind.,1
WILL,2
Are you certain this is the right way?,3
JACK,2
It's the right way.,3
"Will join him and see what Jack is staring at: Treasure piled on treasure, sparkling, glowing, seemingly endless.",1
"At the center is the moonlit clearing, and the stone Aztec chest.",1
BARBOSSA,2
"Thank you, Jack Sparrow.",3
"The jump -- Barbossa is standing right behind them, flanked by his men.",1
The trio whirl to run more pirates emerge from hiding.,1
Nearly the entire crew of the Black Pearl is there.,1
The pirates grab Will and Jack.,1
"Will struggles, but Jack does not fight at all.",1
BARBOSSA,2
You couldn't have led him back more directly if you knew exactly where you were going.,3
"He laughs, and moves toward the stone chest.",1
"The pirates follow, dragging Will and Jack with them.",1
WILL,2
You did know where you were going!,3
You did lead us directly to them!,3
(Jack's silence confirms it),4
Why?,3
Jack looks away as Will is manhandled toward the chest.,1
Barbo8sa steps up to him (becoming skeletal in the moonlight) and puts the medallion around Will's neck.,1
He picks up the stone knife.,1
BARBOSSA,2
"What was begun by blood, let blood now end!",3
He raises the knife to Will's throat -,1
JACK,2
You don't want to be doing that.,3
Barbossa pretends to think about his words.,1
BARBOSSA,2
"No, I really think I do.",3
JACK,2
(shrugs),4
All right then.,3
That makes Barbossa pause.,1
He steps out of the moonlight.,1
BARBOSSA,2
Why don't I want to do this?,3
JACK,2
"Because, right about now, the H.M.S.",3
Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.,3
WILL,2
Jack!,3
JACK,2
and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.,3
A buzz of apprehension sweeps through the pirates.,1
PINTEL,2
Do you believe him?,3
BARBOSSA,2
No.,3
(indicates Will),4
But him I believe.,3
He is genuinely angry.,3
JACK,2
"You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.",3
BARBOSSA,2
What're you suggesting?,3
"Jack shakes off the hands holding him, strolls toward Barbossa, Will, and the chest of coins.",1
JACK,2
Simple.,3
Don't kill the boy yet.,3
Wait for a more opportune moment.,3
"Will glares, listening to every word he says.",1
Jack scoops up a handful of coins from the chest.,1
JACK,2
(drops the coins one-by-,4
one back into the chest),4
Like after you've killed... Every... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.,3
BARBOSSA,2
"I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all?",3
"Last time you did that, it didn't end 80 well for you.",3
JACK,2
The situation has changed.,3
BARBOSSA,2
That so?,3
JACK,2
Aye.,3
"See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S.",3
Dauntless.,3
"There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do?",3
"Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue?",3
"The Dauntless a first-rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas.",3
(beat),4
"But if you're Captain of the Dauntless, who's left for the Black Pearl?",3
Jack smiles and spreads his hands: me.,1
JACK,2
"I sail for you as part of your fleet, I give you fifteen percent of my plunder, and you get to introduce yourself at tea parties and brothels as 'Commodore Barbossa.'",3
(sticks out his hand),4
Do we have an accord?,3
Barbossa licks his lips.,1
It's tempting ...,1
JACK,2
"Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?",3
BARBOSSA,2
Men!,3
Are you up for it?,3
The pirates yell to the affirmative.,1
BARBOSSA,2
"Mr. Pintel, select five men to stay here.",3
Take the rest of the men out ... not through the caves.,3
Jack's expression falters; this he hadn't planned for.,1
JACK,2
There's ... another exit?,3

"Aye, for us there is.",3

The tatters of their clothing drift in the water.,1
Their skull heads are fixed in an endless grin.,1
"The LEAD PIRATE glides forward - And stops next to a huge iron ANCHOR twice his' height, even buried halfway into the sand.",1
"A heavy CHAIN with barrel-sized links climbs up toward the surface - A SHADOW falls across the Lead Pirate he TRANSFORMS, and we see that it is Pintel.",1
"He looks up - Above, the heavy chain leads to the giant bottom hull of the H.M.S.",1
