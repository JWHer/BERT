SCHOOLYARD,5
NIGHT,6
Silence,1
Gradually the sound of distant traffic becomes audible,1
A LOW ANGLE bounded on one side by a chain-link fence and on the other by the one-story public school build- ings,1
Spray-can hieroglyphics and distant streetlight sha- dows,1
This is a Los Angeles public school in a blue collar neighborhood.,1
"ANGLE BETWEEN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, where a trash dumpster looms in a LOW ANGLE, part of the clutter behind the gymnasium.",1
A CAT enters FRAME,1
"CAMERA DOLLIES FORWARD, prowling with him through the landscape of trash receptacles and shadows.",1

Papers blow across the pavement.,1
The cat YOWLS and hides under the dumpster.,1
Windows rattle in their frames.,1

CAMERA MOVES UP as Terminator approaches the schoolyard fence beyond which is an embankment rolling down in darkness to the cityscape below,1
The school is perched at the edge of a pro- montory offering a respectable view of the urban sprawl teem- ing and glistening under a sullen sky,1

Without warning Terminator hammer-punches him in the temple with blinding speed,1
The blow flings him with a CLANG into the jungle gym,1
"He drops to the ground in a still heap, eyes open, twitching.",1

"ANGLE - PAVEMENT, as the knife clatters down",1
"The punk's combat boots are on tiptoe, barely touching the ground.",1

A crinkled burn scar traverses one side of his face from chin to forehead,1
"Other scars, from burns and bullets, mar his hard-muscled body.",1
"The rain washes a fine coating of white ash from his skin as electrical ARCS lace back and forth between the fire escapes behind him, HISSING and SPUTTERING",1
