THE CAMERA PULLS BACK. . .,4
INT,0
ARGO CITY,5
AND REVEALS THE inside of a domed city honeycombed with fantastic arches,1
The city is inhabited by young beautiful people in luxurious but simple costumes,1
"THE CAMERA ROAMS through the City, observing some people seated at a kind of cafe sipping drinks and relaxing other people are in some kind of exercise class doing beautiful graceful movement and finally a class of five year old children listen intently to a teacher who is demonstrating a molecular model",1
TEACHER,2
"And now, who can give me the electron wave functions for Kryptonian covalent bonding?",3
The five year olds eagerly raise their hands,1
The teacher points to one,1
CHILD,2
The cube root of the wavelength over the natural log of the integral of the speed of light squared,3
The teacher smiles,1
TEACHER,2
"Well, maybe that was a bit too easy",3
"THE CAMERA ROAMS ON through the city, following the sound of a strange, ethereally beautiful singing",1
The CAMERA discovers the source of the sound an ARTIST sculpting a beautiful crystalline object with a MATTERWAND,1
The wand makes the singing noise as it creates matter out of energy,1
"The Artist, whose name is ZALTAR, sometimes whistles along in counterpoint",1
,
A small girl is watching him with fascination,1
"Her name is Kara, and she is seven",1
"Behind her, the dome, which encloses the City, marks the edge of the limbo outside",1
KARA,2
What are you making,3
ZALTAR,2
"It's going to be a tree, I think",3
KARA,2
What's a tree?,3
ZALTAR,2
It's something they have on Earth,3
"You know, where your cousin went",3
KARA,2
Where is Earth?,3
ZALTAR,2
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?,3
KARA,2
"Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in my head",3
Zaltar laughs,1
ZALTAR,2
Even I have trouble with that sometimes,3
Earth is in outer space,3
And we're in inner space,3
,
KARA,2
I don't understand,3
ZALTAR,2
Wait till you're older,3
Here -- watch this,3
,
Zaltar takes a small OMEGAHEDRON out of his pocket and holds it in his hand,1
ZALTAR.,2
This is one of the four Power Sources of the City,3
,
I borrowed it from the Guardians,3
Look what I can do with it,3
,
Zaltar touches his MATTER,1
WAND to the OMEGAHEDRON and the wand instantly becomes charged with flickering light,1
He touches his wand to the tree sculpture---and the sculpture comes alive with dancing lights and shadows,1
Kara claps her hands with delight at the spectacle,1
Zaltar steps back and admires his handiwork,1
He carefully puts down the,1
"OMEGAHEDRON at his feet, takes a small flask from his belt, and drinks",1
ZALTAR,2
"You see, a tree is a living thing",3
KARA,2
Can you create life?,3
,
ZALTAR,2
"No, no, just the illusion of life",3
"A kind of half-life, maybe",3
A pale shadow of the real thing,3
"But it is lovely, the way the light plays over the surface",3
,
,
,
A woman's voice can be heard calling in the distance,1
WOMAN'S VOICE,2
Kara,3
Kara,3
Kara calls out in reply,1
KARA,2
"I'm here, mother",3
Kara's mother ALURA appears through the lacey architecture of the city,1
ALURA,2
"Kara, you shouldn't be so near the Edge without a grown-up",3
KARA,2
"I'm sorry, Mother",3
ZALTAR,2
I was keeping an eye on her,3
"Alura puts her arm around her daughter affectionately, showing she's not really angry",1
"Together they watch Zaltar's latest sculpture, flickering with the play of inner light and shadow",1
ALURA,2
"Thank you, Zaltar, but she has to obey the rules",3
Zaltar takes another swig from his flask and lowers his voice confidentially,1
ZALTAR,2
"You and your husband have been kind to me,",3
Alura,2
I have something to tell you,3
I'm going away,3
Soon,3
ALURA,2
But where?,3
Zaltar bends down to Kara and hands her his matterwand,1
ZALTAR,2
"Put your fingers there, Kara",3
And press hard,3
"She does, and the wand makes a horrible squawk",1
Kara laughs with delight,1
ZALTAR,2
Good,3
"Now, go make something pretty",3
"Kara scampers away, hardly able to believe her good fortune, and starts to make all kinds of surprising sounds with the wand on the plaza nearby",1
"Zaltar speaks to Alura in a low, confidential voice",1
ZALTAR,2
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom,3
Zone,3
ALURA,2
But the phantom Zone is for criminals,3
ZALTAR,2
It's big,3
And empty,3
I'm tired of limiting myself to  Argo City,3
I want to do something new,3
"I'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy, glittery stuff",3
Zaltar waves a hand deprecatingly at the city around him,1
ALURA,2
But Zaltar---you founded the city! It's yours,3
"We were all just refugees from Krypton when you gathered us together and brought us here, to the inner dimension",3
,
You can't abandon us now,3
You have a responsibility to us!,3
"In the background, Kara has been modeling a spiky insect-like CREATURE",3
Now she suddenly finds the OMEGAHEDRON on the ground beside her,1
She doesn't stop to wonder how it got there from beside Zaltar's feet,1
She simply picks up the OMEGAHEDRON and touches it to the spiky creature,1
"The creature suddenly flicks its wings and COMES TO LIFE, unnoticed by the adults",1
"Kara drops the wand and laughs out loud with delight as the magical creature takes off from the ground and starts flying in circles around her head, glittering as if it were made of diamonds",1
ZALTAR,2
"I'm an artist, Alura",3
My work comes first,3
Other people come second,3
ALURA,2
How can you create beauty with a selfish heart?,3
"The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily",1
Her look of delight turns to fear,1
She tries to shoo the creature away,1
It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city,1
The spiky creature flies into the membrane and tears a ragged hole in it,1
With a giant WHOOSH all the air in the city starts to rush out the hole,1
Kara is swept along toward the hole by the wind,1
She cries out and stretches pleading hands toward her mother,1
THE OMEGAHEDRON is swept toward the hole as well,1
Kara grabs onto the ragged edge of the membrane,1
ZALTAR,2
Kara---the Power Source!,3
"Kara reaches for it, but it is too far from her, and the OMEGAHEDRON is sucked out into infinity by the wind",1
Zaltar picks up the matterwand from where Kara dropped it and touches her with the wand,1
She is instantly held fast,1
Zaltar pulls her back inside,1
He gives her to her mother Alura,1
Then Zaltar touches his wand to the membrane and seals the hole with masterful chords like a brass choir,1
,
"The wind dies down and all is silent, except for the quiet sobbing of Kara in her mother's arms",1
Zaltar kneels down beside her and strokes her golden hair  tenderly,1
KARA,2
I'm sorry,3
I didn't know,3
ZALTAR,2
It was my fault,3
You aren't old enough to use the wand,3
I shouldn't have given it to you,3
ALURA,2
"But the Power Source, Zaltar",3
ZALTAR,2
It couldn't be helped,3
The city will have to make do with three,3
ALURA,2
But what will happen?,3
ZALTAR,2
The Guardians will be angry,3
They may even send me to the Phantom Zone,3
"You see, I didn't really have permission to borrow it",3
I must go explain to them,3
Zaltar hurries off nervously,3
THE CAMERA HOLDS ON KARA'S FACE as she senses this may be her last sight of Zaltar,1

#NAME?,0
UNDER TITLES,0
A beautiful blonde in jeans and a frilly blouse is walking across a field of wildflowers,1
Butterflies flitter and dart from flower to flower,1
The blonde's name is SELENA,1
"She is our ideal image of the girl next door, who grew up into a dynamite lady",1
"Her current boyfriend follows along behind her, lugging a big wicker hamper from their pickup truck parked at the edge of the road",1
Selena finds a grassy spot under an old oak and spreads out a red and white checked gingham cloth,1
SELENA,2
Over here George,3
It's the perfect spot,3
Nice view,3
George sets down the wicker basket and Selena starts to unpack a scrumptious picnic of home cooked food,1
"She unpacks fried chicken, hard-boiled eggs, potato salad, cold beer and a big rich creamy-frosted devils food cake",1
GEORGE,2
"You sure are a good cook, Selena",3
"Man, that looks too pretty to eat",3
SELENA,2
Better eat it quick,3
It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants,3
She hands him a chicken drumstick and a hard-boiled egg,1
GEORGE,2
"Selena, I've been thinking",3
It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you,3
SELENA,2
"Why George, are you proposing?",3
GEORGE,2
"Marry me, Selena",3
"The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but",3
SELENA,2
George---I thought you'd never ask,3
A shrill whistling sound from above makes them look up,1
With a loud plop and a spatter of icing the OMEGAHEDRON falls into the middle of the chocolate cake,1
GEORGE,2
What the heck is that?,3
"They look up in the boughs of the tree overhead, and then down at the chocolate cake splashed all over the checked cloth",1
SELENA,2
A squirrel Frisbee?,3
Selena reaches out and picks up the OMEGAHEDRON,1
"It comes away from the cake without a trace of the chocolate icing sticking to its surface, as if made of some substance, which repels other kinds of matter",1
"Selena holds the shining Omegahedron in her hand and examines it, turning it around and around as if hypnotized",1
Her face takes on a new expression,1
"Almost as if the simple, wholesome innocence of her nature had been blasted away by some profound new knowledge of the universe",1
SELENA,2
That's funny,3
"I'd swear I know just what this is, but I've never seen it before",3
"She stands up and walks across the checkered cloth, in a beeline for the pickup truck",1
GEORGE,2
"Hey, where you going?",3
SELENA,2
(calling over her shoulder),4
I've got things to do,3
GEORGE,2
What about my proposal?,3
SELENA,2
(dismissively),4
Call me next week,3
Maybe we can have lunch,3
She gets in the pickup and drives away,1
GEORGE,2
Hey! My truck!,3

KARA' S FACE,5
"She is ten years older now, a young lady",1
"Almost ready to assume the long flowing gown of an adult, but still in the tunic worn by those under eighteen",1
ALURA,2
(voice over),4
"But Kara, you are too young to go",3
ANOTHER ANGLE. ARGO CITY. DIMMED,5
"They are in the assembly amphitheater of the city, where the kindergarten nuclear physics class was seen",1
"Kara is in the centre of the ring, with adults seated in scattered rows around her",1
Her parents Zor-El and Alura are standing in front of her,1
KARA,2
I am almost an adult,3
This is what I want,3
ZOR-EL,2
"But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to",3
Earth,3
The journey is dangerous,3
KARA,2
It was my fault we lost the Power Source,3
ZOR-EL,2
Years ago,3
And it was Zaltar who stole it,3
KARA,2
I allowed it to escape the City,3
ALURA,2
"Ever since we told you how your cousin Superman was sent there as an infant, all you have wanted to do was visit this place",3
KARA,2
"Yes, I do want to go",3
But someone must go,3
Our scanning shows the Power Source has finally reached the Earth,3
It could destroy everything unless someone brings it back,3
ZOR-EL,2
Superman will return it,3
KARA,2
Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago,3
He may be dead,3
ZOR-EL,2
"But what can you, a mere girl-",3
KARA,2
I'll have super powers there,3
Like him,3
We can't wait,3
,
Our lights are fading,3
Look around you,3
When I was a child the City was bright and shining,3
Look at it now,3
Zor-El and Alura sigh,1
There is no denying that the brilliance of Argo City has been much dimmed since Kara was a little girl,3
ALURA,2
What do your teachers think?,3
Zor-El looks around the circle,1
A beautiful woman speaks,1
TEACHER,2
It would be sad to lose one of our finest young ones to the dimension barrier-- but the City cannot last much longer without the Power Source,3
"It is her future she's fighting for, Zor-El",3
ZOR-EL,2
"Very well, let it be done",3
"Alura embraces Kara emotionally, fighting back the tears",1
Kara too is struggling to control her own emotions,1
KARA,2
"Don't worry, Mother, I'll be all right",3
I've studied the transmissions from Earth,3
I know their customs,3
Kara walks out of the amphitheater with her parents,1
ALURA,2
"But they are such strange, unstable people",3
KARA,2
Then I will learn to act strange like them,3
Kara holds up a small handbag,1
Inside we glimpse red and blue material,1
KARA,2
"I have made clothing and copies of their money, I will be fine",3
Her father puts his hand on her shoulder,1
ZOR-EL,2
"Be brave, my daughter",3
Be wise,3
KARA,2
As brave as my father,3
As wise,3
"They embrace, briefly",1
Kara then steps onto a circular platform set into the pavement of the city,1
Instantly transparent bubble forms around her,1
Her parents watch as she floats away,1
"She passes into an air lock through the membrane that surrounds the City, and off into an infinity of space",1
"MONTAGE: THE JOURNEY OF KARA INSIDE ""HER SPHERE FROM THE INNER DIMENSION TO OUR WORLD.",0
"Her sphere moves from blackness, to a dark green limbo",1
The atmosphere thickens around her,1
"Soon it is unmistakably water, and she is heading toward the light above",1
A fish darts past with a flash of silver,1
The sphere rushes upward faster and faster,1
"It breaks the surface of the , water",1
"Kara springs free of the bubble, which disappears",1
She is now wearing a blue and red costume like her cousin Superman,1
She lands on a nearby beach,1

SUNRISE,6
"She looks around her, feasting with her eyes on the details of this new exciting world",1
Kara bends down and picks up a stone from the ground at her feet,1
"To her astonishment, she crushes it to powder in her hand, and blows the fine dust away with a blast of superbreath",1
"She looks down at her feet, so firmly planted on the ground",1
"She rises a few inches into the air, and reacts with amazement",1
Then she looks up into the blue sky overhead and her expression of astonishment is replaced by a look of joyous longing,1
With a sudden impulse she shoots straight upward,1

FOREST,5
DAY,6
She lands and walks among the huge trunks of a primeval forest,1
Shafts of sunlight pierce the gloom,1
These trees are much more impressive than Zaltar's imitation back in Argo City,1
She hears a mournful sound and pulls back a spray of brambles,1
She sees a BABY DEER hopelessly tangled in the long canes,1
She shoots RAYS OF HEAT VISION from her eyes and slices through the tough stems,1
"The fawn scrambles free, and scampers off into the forest",1
Kara watches it with a benevolent smile,1
She removes a brunette wig and some street clothing from a secret pocket in her cape,1
EXT,0
MANSION --- GARDEN PARTY,5
A big impressive house somewhere in the Middle West,1
People mill about on the neatly manicured lawn sipping drinks and snagging hors d'oeuvres off silver trays from passing waiters,1
"All the quests have a name tag on, like at some kind of conference",1
"SELENA, the blonde who discovered the Power Source, is circulating among the quests",1
She has changed since we saw her last,1
"No longer the girl next door, she now wears a fabulous designer dress dripping with jewels",1
"She walks with the regal air of someone used to being obeyed, and graciously accepts the homage of the quests",1
"A smile, a nod, a kind word from her leaves them all basking in the warm afterglow of her attention",1
But we notice odd details of the party the decorations are all based on mystic occult symbols,1
"At the refreshment table, there is a big ten-foot WICKER SCULPTURE OF A FEMALE GOAT covered with paper flowers",1
And the quests all have an indefinable air of strangeness about them,1
"BIANCA, a tall cold-eyed brunette in black silk dress, whispers in Selena's ear",1
BIANCA,2
Be careful,3
Nigel is going to try something,3
SELENA,2
"Don't worry about old Nigel, I can take care of him",3
,
He's just a sore loser,1
An ELDERLY MAN in a three-piece pin-stripe suit grabs her elbow,1
ELDERLY MAN,2
"I don't want much, Selena",3
I have simple tastes,3
SELENA,2
What do you want?,3
ELDERLY MAN,2
Western Europe,3
SELENA,2
"I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland",3
You know how she loves to ski,3
ELDERLY MAN,2
No problem,3
She can have it,3
I hate mountains,3
Selena leaves him negotiating boundary lines with Bianca and strolls over to a sour-faced man in suede who has been scowling at her over his cigarette,1
SELENA,2
"Cheer up, Nigel",3
It's not the end of the world,3
NIGEL,2
It may well be,3
I know how you won that election,3
Selena,3
You can't fool me,3
SELENA,2
I have plans Nigel,3
You could come with me,3
I'm going places,3
NIGEL,2
You're not going anywhere,3
Except back to nowheresville,3
"You're too impatient, Selena",3
Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship,3
Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations,3
,
You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months,3
"Selena smirks at him, self-confidently",3
SELENA,2
I just did,3
Because I have the Power,3
NIGEL,2
You're going to pay a terrible price,3
The power of Shadow is tricky,3
Use it too much and it takes over,3
,
"Nigel drops his cigarette, stubs it out on the lawn, and takes out his platinum cigarette case",1
SELENA,2
Bianca's taught me all! need to know,3
"I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far",3
,
NIGEL,2
Cigarette?,3
He holds the shiny mirror-like cigarette case in front of her so she can see her reflection,1
INSERT,0
SURFACE OF THE CIGARETTE CASE,5
Selena's reflection,1
"She is still the glamorous beauty, but looming behind her invisible to ordinary eyes is a DARK EERIE SHAPE OF SOMETHING HIDEOUS",1
BACK TO SCENE.,0
"Quick as a cat, Selena bats the cigarette case out of his hand and sends it spinning into the shrubbery",1
All traces of the Shadow behind her have disappeared,1
NIGEL,2
Sorry,3
Forgot you were trying to quit,3
Nigel snags a glass of champagne off the tray of a nearby waiter and sips it insolently,3
SELENA,2
"Nigel, get out of here",3
And don't come slithering back,3
Nigel shakes his head,1
NIGEL,2
"You need me, Selena",3
I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate,3
SELENA,2
I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower,3
Now burn rubber,3
Nigel locks eyes with her,3
NIGEL,2
Make me,3
He takes another insolent sip of champagne arid discovers a scorpion perched on the rim of his glass,1
"Nigel spits out the champagne and, drops the glass",1
Everyone laughs at him,1
NIGEL,2
"Balefire on you, Selena!",3
SELENA,2
(grinning),4
You Scorpios can never take a joke,3
"All quests have fallen silent, staring at the altercation between the two of them",1
,
NIGEL,2
You think you are on top now,1
Well there is someone coming to challenge you,1
I saw it in the cards this morning,1
SELENA,2
Throw him out,3
Two burly waiters seize Nigel and drag him off toward the valet parking,1
NIGEL,2
"You won't last a year, Selena",3
The cards don't lie!,3
The crowd breaks into a buzz of conversation,3
,
Bianca stands up on a chair,1
The crowd falls silent,1

BIANCA,2
Let's not let one rotten apple spoil the party,3
I give you the first woman in eight hundred years to head the Circle,3
Selena!,3
Applause,4
Selena steps up onto a raised dais,1
And holds up her hands in an invocational gesture,1
SELENA,2
"Thank you, sisters and brothers of the Craft",3
"It is a great honor you have given me, and I will try to be worthy",3
And when my secret plans are revealed -- you will learn that we are on the threshold of power and influence undreamed of when Nigel was our leader,3
More applause,4
One of the cooks applauding at the refreshment table knocks over a fuel-pot under a chafing dish,1
The fuel-pot falls on the ground at the base of the wicker goat statue,1

SELENA,2
"And now, ,I call upon the Great Mother--the spirit of Nature --- to bless all our endeavors in the coming year",3
A woman in the audience screams,1
"Everyone looks where, she is pointing",1
"The huge ten-foot tall wicker statue ,bursts into flames",1
Panic and pandemonium,1
Some of the quests run for safety,1
"Others try to throw water onto the blazing, torch-like statue, but in vain",1

LIVING ROOM,5
THE CAMERA FOLLOWS Selena through the French doors and into her large living room,1
"On one wall is a huge, ornate gold-framed MIRROR, covered with a thick veil",1
"Selena sits down in front of a large hearth, and opens a secret compartment in the floor",1
She reaches inside and removes a finely wrought METAL BOX IN THE SHAPE OF A GARGOYLE and a pack of cards,1
"She puts the gargoyle box on her lap, and begins to cast tarot cards onto the floor in mystic patterns",1
The Elderly Man in the pinstripe suit enters from the garden,1
Outside the excited shouts and sounds of firefighting can still be heard,1
Someone runs by in the b g with a coil of garden hose,1
"The Elderly Man walks over to Selena, timidly",1
ELDERLY MAN,2
Is this Nigel's doing?,3
SELENA,2
"It's a warning, that's for sure",3
ELDERLY MAN,2
Maybe it was just an accident,3
SELENA,2
(mysteriously),4
There's no such thing as an accident,3
"Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs",3
The elderly man looks down at the pattern of tarot cards Selena has cast on the floor,1
ELDERLY MAN,2
Then what does it mean???,3
Selena shrugs and puts aside her cards,1
SELENA,2
Don't ask me,3
I can't read the signs worth spit,3

A bus stops in front of the school,1
"Kara, disguised in a brunette wig and unfashionable clothing gets out of the bus",1
(From now on we shall refer to her in human guise by the name of her secret identity LINDA LEE),1
Linda walks up the driveway toward the main building,1
"Around her the campus is full of girls all in the school uniform of skirt, blazer, and white knee socks",1
"Many of them stare frankly at the new girl in the slightly dowdy dress, carrying a battered old suitcase",1
"In front of the school, LUCY LANE, one of the older girls, is batting in a softball game",1
She swings and hits one over the fence for a homer,1

The pre-entry signal,1

Ethan is running away down the corridor,
Frightened patients peek out of their rooms,
The nurse who was ejected from the room cringes in fear as Selena emerges into the corridor,
Ethan dodges past two orderlies who are pushing a HEART-LUNG MACHINE down from the surgery,
Selena raises the gargoyle box and points it at the HEART-LUNG MACHINE,
SELENA,
Power of Shadow---seize him,
"The HEART-LUNG MACHINE comes to life---its lights flash, its array of tubes tipped with needle probes writhe like Medusa's hair, its wheels turn around, and it chases  Ethan down the corridor",
Selena laughs her deep throaty chuckle of triumph,
"Ethan looks behind, sees the machine chasing him and cries out with alarm",

Ethan dives through a swinging door to his left,

A team of surgeons and nurses are bent over a patient on the table,
Ethan runs through in the background,
The surgeons continue with their work,
"The heart-lung machine wheels through after him, followed by the scalpels flying through the air like a swarm of hornets",
The surgical team doesn't look up from their work,
Several cylinders of anesthetic gas tear themselves loose from the wall and trundle away out of the room after Ethan and the other apparatus,
One of the nurses finally looks up,
NURSE,
"Doctor, I think you' re going to have a gas problem",
DOCTOR,
I shouldn't have had the cabbage at lunch,
INT,
X-RAY ROOM,
Ethan bursts into an empty surgical X-Ray room---the pursuing apparatus visible a few yards behind,
He slams the heavy lead-lined door and bolts it shut,
He hears the thud of the apparatus beating impotently against the door,

A DELIVERY BOY enters with A SPECTACULAR FLORAL ARRANGEMENT,
DELIVERY BOY,
Where you want this?,
LUCY,
Over by the window,
It must be from my sister,
"Give him a tip, Jimmy",
Jimmy is acutely aware how pathetic his daffodils look as he fumbles in his pocket for a dollar for the delivery boy,
Suddenly overhead there is a loud banging and clattering from the air-conditioning duct,
Everyone looks up at the ceiling with alarm,
But Linda's X-RAY VISION lets her alone recognize Ethan,
JIMMY,
"Gosh, what do you suppose that is?",
LINDA,
"Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better",
"Nice to meet you, Jimmy",
LUCY,
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?,
LINDA,
I have to get back,
I'm having dinner with the Danvers,
LUCY,

Linda walks out of Lucy's room and quickly down the corridor,
Jimmy hurries to catch up with her,
JIMMY,

Ethan batters the top off a ventilator and crawls out onto the roof,

SELENA,
Give up?,
"Ethan  takes a beat to make sure he's not hallucinating, then he summons new reserves of strength and runs over to the TALL BRICK SMOKESTACK from the hospital's incinerator",

At super speed she rips up the entire line of fence posts and hurls them like javelins at Selena,

She turns too quickly and the GARGOYLE BOX slips out of her hand and rolls underneath the deck of the carousel,
"Selena moans with despair, and pauses, reluctant to leave without the box",
This is the opportunity Supergirl needs,

We must destroy her first,

One person must volunteer  to take on the combined power of us all,

You! You want to take our power for yourself!,
"Selena reacts calmly, speaking in low, modulated tones, as if to an overstimulated child",
SELENA,
"Nige1, you know the one who takes on Ultimate",
Power must sacrifice the last sparks of her own spirit,
Selena takes hold of a golden chain hanging around her neck and draws out a little glass vial attached to it,
Inside the glass vial a tiny spark glows brightly,
SELENA,

Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?,
NIGEL,
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power,
SELENA,

Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much,

Nonsense,
Nigel pulls aside the heavy veil covering her mirror,
"FOR AN INSTANT SELENA SEES HER REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR. BEHIND HER LOOMS THE DARK, EVIL PRESENCE, INVISIBLE TO THE OTHERS IN THE ROOM, AND MUCH LARGER THAN WHEN SHE GLIMPSED IT AT HER GARDEN PARTY.",

"Bianca stands challenging Nigel, daring him to try again",
"Selena looks at the gargoyle-shaped Coffer of Shadow, sitting beside her hearth",
It too seems much larger than when we last saw it at the hospital,
Selena wonders for a beat if maybe Nigel is right,
Can the Shadow be ruling her?,
BIANCA,
Enough quibbling,
Let us vote,
They all draw their sacred white-handled knives out of concealment in their clothing,
Nigel defiantly places his on the floor with its blade pointing inward,
"Then one by one, the others put down their knives with the blades pointing outward",

Nigel speaks with the voice of someone pronouncing his own death sentence,

I have no choice,
His knife turns by itself on the floor until its blade points outward,
Everyone joins hands in the circle,
A fire springs to life on the hearth,
Someone starts to chant in a strange ancient tongue,
"Slowly the heavy, opulent living room begins to change the carpet becomes the floor of an ancient stone temple with dark brown stains splattered across its massive granite blocks, the walls start to melt away",
"Outside the windows the dark night is replaced by hot, brutal sunlight pounding down on an endless desert stretching away to the horizon",
The house completely dissolves and is replaced by monumental stone ruins,
The smoky fire crackles and sends its dark plumes boiling skyward,
The only thing remaining of Selena's house is the hearth and the Coffer of Shadow,
Selena stands up And walks out of the centre of the circle toward the Coffer,

Selena steps forth from the column of fire,
She is clothed in a shimmering garment---white with flashing highlights of rainbow iridescence,
The six other members of her group fall to their knees in awe,
Selena seems to glow with an inner radiance,

It's just,
I miss it,
SUPERGIRL,
Miss what?,
ETHAN,
What I had before,
What's not there now,
It's like I woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more something that made me feel really alive and aware of things,
"It was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world around us--like we were a wonderful song",
"He falls silent, and tosses a few pebbles into the stream",
SUPERGIRL,
And now?,
ETHAN,
"And now the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike",
SUPERGIRL,
Well,
"I don It know much about these things, but maybe if you had that feeling once it can, come back",
,
He turns to her hopefully,
ETHAN,
You think so?,
SUPERGIRL,
I don't see why not,
ETHAN,
But what if---it wasn't real?,
SUPERGIRL,
Feelings are real,
"Once you've had them, they're yours forever",
Ethan's face lights up,
The future begins to exist for him again,
ETHAN,
"Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other",
And maybe something might happen again,
,
What do you think?,
SUPERGIRL,
"Are you asking me for a ""date""?",
ETHAN,
Why not? You're a good-looking girl,
And I'm--- available,
SUPERGIRL,
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?,
ETHAN,
She'll forget about us eventually,

SUPERGIRL,
That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo,
City! That's what I came to find! Where does she live?,
ETHAN,
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there,
SUPERGIRL,
I can see through walls,
I could surprise her,
"The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park",
She stands up,
ETHAN,
Wait,
Don't leave me,
SUPERGIRL,
You'll be safe here,
I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source,
He stands up and takes her hand,
ETHAN,
Before you go,
SUPERGIRL,
What?,
ETHAN,
Just one kiss,
For old times' sake,
SUPERGIRL,
"And you can see how you feel about me, right?",
ETHAN,
Yes,
She closes her eyes and parts her lips,
Slowly their lips come together and touch,
Then a sudden rush of sheer desire flows through them and the simple experimental kiss become an ecstatic prelude to the heights of lovemaking,
"But before either one of them can go one step further, ETHAN DISAPPEARS WITH A FLASH OF BLINDING WHITE LIGHT",

FRONT HALL/LIVING ROOM,
Supergirl looks around,
The house seems deserted and drastically neglected,
Cobwebs hang over everything,
The dust has the thickness of a hundred years,
Moths have eaten away all the splendid tapestries,
Rats cavort along the baseboards,
Bats sleep in the chandeliers,
"In the living room Supergirl finds Bianca crouched in A Corner, gibbering mindlessly",
"Bianca too has changed she is dressed in rags, and her wild staring eyes are rimmed with dark circles",
When she sees Supergirl she cries with fright,
SUPERGIRL,
Hey take it easy,
I won't hurt you,
BIANCA,
"I thought it was her, coming back",
Spared me,

But I thought,

 maybe changed her mind,

Nigel warned us,
Wouldn't listen to him,

BIANCA,
No,
Don't want to know,
She's bad,
Don't go near her,
Hurt you,

I have to find her,
Tell me,

Bianca points to the adjoining bar,
Supergirl walks over warily and sees FIVE GOLDEN CAGES suspended among the bottles,

Nige1 is in a perpetually turning squirrel wheel,
He sees her and calls out,
NIGEL,

SELENA'S NEW HOUSE (A MOUNTAIN-TOP PALACE),
"Ethan is in a dark, shadowy place, bound to a stake with stout cords",
Sticks of wood are piled all around his feet,
Selena stands beside him in her shining gown of power,
She looks even more gorgeous and cruel than before,
"She offers him a glass of water to drink, but he turns his head away violently",
ETHAN,
"I'm wise to your tricks, lady",
SELENA,
I could force you,
ETHAN,
"If that worked, you would've done it already",
"No, you want me to drink it of my own free will",
"Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again",
SELENA,
"Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten",
"She puts the glass of water in a, basket at the end of an iron chain hanging down from above",
There is a straw in the glass at such an angle that Ethan can just reach it with his lips if he stretches as far as possible,
SELENA,
You've been without water for a whole day,
Let's see how thirsty you get in a week,
ETHAN,
You vicious--,
SELENA,
"Careful, don't make me angry",
I start fires when I'm angry,
She glances meaningfully at the faggots piled around his feet and walks away,
THE CAMERA FOLLOWS HER revealing that she has been talking to Ethan inside the mammoth fireplace of her living room,
Her new house is enormous,
"Where before she lived in a mansion, now she dwells in a palace",
"The fireplace is seven feet high, the living room floor is wide as a football field, and the French windows into the garden now tower like the windows in the North transept of Chartres Cathedral",
Selena disappears out the imposing portals which lead to the wet bar and butler's pantry--each now the size of a basketball court,
"Back in the fireplace, Ethan cranes his neck to make sure she has gone, then reaches out toward the glass hanging nearby",
He pokes the straw with his forehead,
The glass swings slightly,
The glass swings close enough for him to bump it with his forehead and set up a rhythm,
"He gauges the swing of the glass and, at the precise moment, grabs for it with his mouth",
He catches hold of the rim of the glass with his teeth and holds it there for a moment as he summons his courage to do what must be done,
He bites hard on the rim of the glass with his teeth,
"The glass shatters and falls to the floor with a crash, leaving Ethan with a small fragment of the rim in his mouth and a trickle of blood down his chin",
He leans his head over until it is directly above his left hand tied to the stake two and a half feet below his shoulders,
A droplet of blood falls into his hand,
He drops the glass fragment down to his hand and catches it,
"He grins, and sighs with relief",
Then spits to clear his mouth,
Slowly he saws at the ropes that hold him with the sliver of glass in his left hand,
One by one the strands part,
Ethan strains against his bonds and the weakened rope snaps,
He quickly disentangles himself from the coils and steps out of the fireplace,
He looks around the mammoth room,
The coast is clear,
"He spits a few bits of glass out of his mouth, and dashes out of the doors to the garden",
EXT,
SELENA'S HOUSE,
GARDEN,

"Ethan sees a green plastic garden hose, which the gardener has left running in a trickle to irrigate the hydrangeas",
Ethan remembers that he is very thirsty,
"He picks up the hose, rinses out his mouth hurriedly, and then takes long, desperate gulps of the water",
Behind him he hears Selena's laughter,
He drops the hose as if stung by an electric eel and turns to see her emerge from behind a large strangler fig,
INSERT ETHAN'S P.O.V.,
The same effect as when he drank the love potion the first time,
The plants of the conservatory swirl and distort in garish nightmare colours,
At the centre of his vision is an area of crystal clarity surrounding Selena,
"She approaches him seductively, fully confident of her power",
"As she comes nearer, the clear area expands and drives out the visual chaos",
"Selena speaks, and her voice is a close-miked throaty purr",
SELENA,
I told you I'd win,
BACK TO SCENE,
Ethan is held by the spell of her magic,
And yet there is part of him that still resists,
"You can see him try to turn his head away from the vision of ideal beauty before him, and then give in as she comes closer and I touches him with her hand",
A zap of energy passes between them at her touch,
SELENA,
Kiss me,

He embraces her roughly and crushes her lips with a kiss,
He is filled with a tigerish lust that thrills her deeply,

She turns and enters the gigantic conservatory to her right,

Supergirl looks around and sees in the middle of the conservatory a reflecting pool surrounded by exotic plants,
She walks closer and looks down into the reflecting pool,
In the bottom of the shallow pool she sees Ethan securely bound,
His eyes stare wildly,
Dead or drowning,
SUPERGIRL,
Ethan!,
"She leaps into the shallow pool, and sinks over her head",
A polygonal section of the surface of the reflecting pool detaches itself from the water and rises up perpendicularly,
It is a door to the Phantom Zone,
"Supergirl is trapped behind an impenetrable force field, looking out in despair",
Ethan is not there with her,
His image has disappeared,

The real flesh and blood Ethan appears with Selena from behind the strangler fig,
They look in at Supergirl trapped behind the shimmering polygon that la ads to the Phantom Zone,
"Selena laughs at her, but Ethan stares as if at a long forgotten acquaintance whose name he is trying to recall",
Selena notices Ethan's wandering attention and she puts her arms possessively around him,

Behind the transparent surface we can see Supergirl's face stained with tears,

Another kind of reality,
Unlike anything we have ever seen,
The crystal prison lands on the ground of the Phantom Zone and shatters,
Supergirl picks herself up from among the fragments of her prison and looks around,
"The landscape is utterly strange and alien, with a feel of stark, oppressive sterility",
As far as the eye can see there is no sign of life,
Supergirl stands up and raises her arms to fly,
She hops into the air about eight inches and lands flat-footedly on the sand,
With a shock she realises SHE CAN'T FLY,
"She hops a few more times, with no more success",
She picks up a small rock from the ground,
She tries to crush it in her hand,
She can't,
Angrily she hurls it from her as far as she can,
Instead of disappearing into infinity it drops at her feet a few yards away,
She scoops up some sand from the ground and holds it cupped in her hand,
She takes a deep breath and tries to blow it away,
She is barely able to disturb a few grains,
"She drops the sand and sits down on a rock, forlorn and dejected",
"Suddenly she hears Alura's voice, very faint and coming from a long distance away",
ALURA'S VOICE,

The DELEGATE FROM URITANIA is going on (in Esperanto) denouncing the latest outrage against his peace-loving country,
A few bored DELEGATES of various nationalities are sprawled in their seats listening to the simultaneous translation over earphones,
The dign1fied PRESIDENT of the General Assembly is sitting on the dais behind the ranting delegate,
"With a FLASH OF LIGHT and a chok1ng cloud of sulfur fumes, Selena appears beside the podium",
She is in her shimmering white robe,
The dozing delegates wake up with amazement,
The URITANIAN delegate stares at her with his mouth open as she slides him away from the microphone,

"Selena is about to speak in the microphone, when two SECURITY GQUARDS attempt to step onto the podium",
Selena reaches out toward them,
"A field of force from her hands stops them in their tracks, knocking them backwards off the steps to land on their butts",
The delegates gasp at this act of magical violence,
SELENA,
Nations of the world! I bring you tidings of a new age!,
The President of the General Assembly starts to shout at her and bang on the podium with his gavel,
Selena looks over her shoulder with mild annoyance,
Instantly the President's gavel turns into a live eel,
The President drops it with horror,
Selena continues her speech,
SELENA,
I bring you a return to the ancient true worship of,
"Nature, our Sovereign Queen and Mother",
And,
I bring you myself as her representative here on Earth,
The URITANIAN suddenly recovers his wits and tries to place a hand on Selena's shoulder,
A whirlwind hurls him off the podium into the desks of the front row delegates,
The delegates babble in consternation but keep to their seats,
Selena raises her voice to be heard over the uproar,
SELENA,
"From this moment forth, all science, religion and other unnatural beliefs are forbidden",
And in their place I will teach the One True Way of our ancient grandmothers,
The President of the General Assembly has recovered enough from the surprise of the eel to interrupt Selena,
PRESIDENT,
You are talking about the end of Civilisation as we know it,
SELENA,
And it's about time too,
PRESIDENT,
"I do not know who you are, or what evil force you represent, but it will take more than a few threats from you to make mankind turn back the clock and abandon thousands of years of progress",
Selena has listened with a mocking smile as he speaks,
He finishes to a smattering of applause from some of the delegates,
SELENA,
Threats? I don't need threats to destroy civilisation,

I have something better,
She snaps her fingers in the air,
Immediately a RAIN OF MONEY BEGINS TO FALL ALL OVER THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY,
PAPER MONEY AND COINS OF ALL NATIONS,
Selena looks at her work with pleasure,
Then she disappears in a FLASH OF LIGHT,
The delegates blink with astonishment,
The only trace of her presence is the tang of sulfur in the air---and the money,
One delegate forgets his dignity and starts scooping up money from his desk and stuffing it into his pockets,
Suddenly all the delegates are doing the same thing,
"The only exception is the delegate from the United Kingdom who thinks it might be beneath his dignity, and looks about with mild disapproval",

Supergirl walks across the rolling monotony of the Phantom Zone,
"We have never seen her like this before sweating, her hair unkempt, streaks of dirt and grit on her face, exhausted and full of despair",
"She stumbles at the crest of a low ridge and falls down to the bottom of the slope, banging her head on a rock",
"She sits there, a big rip in her ,uniform, rubbing her bruised forehead",
It is hard to imagine her any worse off,
"She hears a sound, vaguely familiar",
She looks around for its source,
"She follows the sound, crawling slowly along the base of the ridge",
"The sound gets louder and as she, approaches",
"It is a sound of celestial, spiritual beauty the music of the spheres",
Suddenly she comes out into a tiny valley in the Phantom Zone and sees before her the most beautiful sight she could imagine,
The harsh monochromatic sterility of the Phantom Zone gives way to a riot of bright colours,
A dome-like building protrudes from the ground,
All around it are gorgeous singing sculptures in the style of Argo City,
A sculptor in the clothing of Argo City is modeling a glassy statue with a matterwand,
He turns and catches sight of Supergirl,
It is Zaltar,
SUPERGIRL,
Zaltar,
Zaltar drops his wand and comes running over to Supergirl,
He kneels beside her on the sandy ground,
ZALTAR,
Kara? Is it you?,
Supergirl nods,
She is obviously exhausted,
Zaltar takes the bulb full of liquid off his belt and offers her a drink,
"She drinks thirstily of the refreshing green liquid, and feels strength returning to her body",
SUPERGIRL,
What is this place?,
ZALTAR,
This is the Phantom Zone,
But why did you come here from Argo City?,
SUPERGIRL,
I was on Earth,
ZALTAR,
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?,
SUPERGIRL,
Yes,
I went there to find the lost Power Source,
ZALTAR,
Shouldnt've done that,
"SUPERGIRL but the person who has it tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone",
ZALTAR,
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth,
It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---,
SUPERGIRL,
I know,
ZALTAR,
"Well, nothing we can do about it",
Come into my house,

"You can stay with me, until I build you your own place",
I expect you won't want to mix with the others-- not our type of people,

The curves of the arches and the materials are strongly reminiscent of Zaltar's work on Argo City,
SUPERGIRL,
Others?,
ZALTAR,
Criminals,
Zaltar gestures vaguely to the horizon on his right,
ZALTAR,
A few hundred parasangs that way,
I avoid them,
And you should too,
Zaltar leads Supergirl past the singing sculptures,
"She smiles as she passes them, and remembers his ""tree"" in Argo City",

He helps her down a long spiraling staircase to the floor of a high domed room,
"In the centre of the room is a huge round table cluttered with tools, models and unfinished projects",
SUPERGIRL,
It's lovely,

ZALTAR,
"No, no",
Not lovely,
'Perfect',
Did everything just right,
"Nobody telling you to change this, move that around",
Please yourself,
That's the secret of happiness,
SUPERGIRL,
"Are you happy, Zaltar?",
ZALTAR,
What kind of a question is that? Of course,
I am,
I do whatever I want,
All the time,
SUPERGIRL,
But what about other people? Don't you miss them?,
They have reached the ground floor,
Zaltar plucks one of the liquid filled bulbs from the stem of a large plant growing in a niche in the wall,
He squirts some of the green liquid in his mouth with great satisfaction,
ZALTAR,
I look at them all the time,
Every planet in the galaxy,
,
It's quite boring,
"Here, rub some of this onto that bruise",
He carefully applies some of the green liquid to the wound on her scalp,
SUPERGIRL,
You look at them? How?,
ZALTAR,
The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere,
If you have the right tools,
Zaltar sweeps the clutter off the table and onto the floor,
"He passes his hand over the table and instantly the table turns into a WINDOW INTO ANOTHER WORLD, showing an image of a herdboy riding on the back of a water buffalo in a rice paddy",
ZALTAR,
There you see? What could be more boring than that?,
"He waves his hand, and the image disappears",
SUPERGIRL,
Wait,
Could could I see the place I just came from?,
"Zaltar sighs with great martyrdom, and starts to fiddle with his controls",
ZALTAR,
It'll only make you sad,

ETHAN,
I'll mention it upstairs,
"He turns to go, but Jimmy reaches out and grabs his sleeve",
JIMMY,
The blonde girl who saved your life---where is she now?,
Ethan pauses,
"Buried memories rise to the surface of his mind, bringing pain",
ETHAN,
She's gone,
No one will ever see her again,
CUT TO:,
INT,
ZALTAR'S HOUSE IN THE ZONE,
"Supergirl waves her hand over the table angrily, decisively",
"The WINDOW of the Zone closes, and the image of Ethan disappears",
"She crosses to Zaltar, who is reclining on a couch in an adjoining room, getting drunk on the green liquid from the plant bladders",
SUPERGIRL,
"Zaltar, please help me",
ZALTAR,
"Of course, my dear",
What can I do?,
SUPERGIRL,
Help me to get back to Earth,
Where my friends are,
,
They need me,
"Zaltar looks pained, and takes several deep drinks of green plant sap before he answers",
ZALTAR,
There's no way out of the Zone,
No one's ever escaped,
,
That's why they send the criminals here,
SUPERGIRL,
"If there's a way in, there must be a way out",
ZALTAR,
"No, that's not true---there's well no--",
"He suddenly has an idea, vaguely forming at the back of his drink-sodden brain",
"He toys with it, while Supergirl leans forward eagerly, waiting",
"He changes his mind several times about whether it's possible or not, each time changing his facial expression",
Supergirl has the feeling she's watching a debate conducted by squints and grimaces,
ZALTAR,
There is a way,
SUPERGIRL,
I knew it!,
ZALTAR,
But it's impossible,
SUPERGIRL,
Why?,
ZALTAR,
"No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it",
Forget I mentioned it,
Supergirl's heart sinks,
"She rocks back, clutching her knees, trying not to show her sadness",
ZALTAR,
I could do it,
She is suddenly all excitement and hopefulness again,
SUPERGIRL,
Then teach me how,
ZALTAR,
"No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go",
A thing like that,
No,
"Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think",
He takes another sip of his drink,
SUPERGIRL,
Tell me how to do it,
"If you could do it, I can",
"He looks at her shrewdly, appraising her abilities with a suddenly lucid glance",
ZALTAR,
"Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand",
,
Just begun to understand it myse1f,
Give things a kind of life--can also take away life works backwards too,
Besides I can't let you take my wand,
"Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless",
It's out of the question,
SUPERGIRL,
Then come with me,
ZALTAR,
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?,
SUPERGIRL,
You could do anything,
You could sculpt mountain ranges draw with rainbows!,
You'd have superpowers,
ZALTAR,
Superpowers,
"Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?",
SUPERGIRL,
Please,
I have to get back to Earth,
My friends are in trouble,
And unless I bring back the Power,
"Source, Argo City will die",
"He looks at her kneeling beside his couch, tears streaming down her cheeks, pleading with him",
ZALTAR,
"Oh, all right",
Stop crying,
Let's go,
"He stands up, takes his matterwand, and heads for the stairs up to the surface",
Supergirl can hardly believe her plea has been granted,
"She runs after him, up the stairs",
SUPERGIRL,
You're going to take me back?,
ZALTAR,
Going to try,
Didn't say I could,
EXT,
ZALTAR' S HOUSE,
PHANTOM ZONE,
They emerge from the circular doorway out onto the flat monotonous terrain of the zone,
"Zaltar pauses for a moment to get his bearings, then strikes out with long energetic strides",
Supergirl hurries to keep up with him,
SUPERGIRL,
"I heard my mother ask you once ""how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?""",
"She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart",
ZALTAR,
Not doing this for you,
"Just sick of this place, that's all",
"Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you",
Boring!,
"Supergirl scampers along beside him, smiling",
"Zaltar never looks back at his abandoned house, but keeps his gaze fixed on the horizon straight ahead",

SELENA'S NEW HOUSE,
HALLWAY,
Ethan is walking down the hall and sees guards dragging Lucy Lane and Jimmy Olsen in chains,
Lucy calls out to him,
LUCY,
"Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs",
ETHAN,
I did,
LUCY,
(bitterly),
"Well thanks a pile, fella",
Ethan watches them dragged away,
He has a puzzled expression on his face,
INT,
SELENA'S LIVING ROOM,
DAY,
Ethan enters,
Selena is staring into her magic mirror,
Her face is white with fear,
ETHAN,
What's going on?,
Selena snaps irritably at him,
SELENA,
Guess! Go on,
ETHAN,
I don't know,
You seem afraid,
SELENA,
"You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?",
ETHAN,
(the truth dawns on him),
Supergirl?,
"Selena doesn't answer, but looks back at the mirror",
Ethan moves to her side and watches with her the IMAGE OF THE PHANTOM ZONE,
INT,
PHANTOM ZONE/QUANTUM VORTEX,
"Zaltar leads the way, firming their path with the matterwand, and then hauling himself and Supergirl forward over an upward sloping, undulating surface",
"Behind them luminescent waves of energy can be seen, like the ocean at the base of a steep cliff, constantly sweeping backwards and downwards, away from their goal",
INT,
SELENA'S NEW LIVING ROOM,
"Selena looks up and realises Ethan is behind her, looking intently at the image",
SELENA,
Quit staring so hard,
You'll strain your eyes,
She puts her hand on his cheek,
He turns away from the image of Supergirl and looks deep in,
Selena's eyes,
ETHAN,
"You're not going to hurt her, are you?",
Selena is furious,
Her eyes get that dangerous look,
SELENA,
"You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?",
ETHAN,
Well,
I guess I can't,
SELENA,
I'm ready for her,
I'll show you,
Selena walks out the French doors followed by the dazed Ethan,
EXT,
CONSERVATORY,
DAY,
MR,
& Mrs,
"Danvers, Lucy Lane, and Jimmy Olsen are imprisoned in four metal cages hanging over the reflecting pool in the conservatory",
"The ropes that keep the cages from falling into the pool are GIGANTIC GOLDEN SERPENTS, their tails around an overhead beam, and the jaws tightly locked on the tops of the cages",
A fifth cage hangs there empty,
The water in the reflecting pool has changed colour to an opaque yellow,
Selena shows the arrangements to Ethan,
SELENA,
"Unless Supergirl agrees to go away forever, the serpents will drop them one by one",
,
"Selena puts a small silver whistle to her lips and blows a high, melodious note",
The fifth serpent opens his jaws and releases the empty cage into the pool,
INSERT: REFLECTING POOL,
"The empty cage lands in the water and is instantly eaten up by the most powerful acid imaginable, leaving nothing but froth and acrid fumes",
Ethan looks down into the cool at his reflection distorted by the spreading ripples,
,
BACK TO SCENE,
ETHAN,
Why the empty cage?,
SELENA,
That one was for you,
But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here,
"I'd hate to lose you, Ethan",
Selena steps beside him and puts her hand on his shoulder,
Ethan cries out with terror,
Selena looks down at what he sees,
INSERT: REFLECTING POOL,
"Behind Selena, distorted almost beyond recognition by the ripples on the surface, is a GIANT MONSTROUS SHADOW-BEING, ITS ARMS OUTSTRETCHED, ALMOST ENVELOPING HER, but invisible except in reflections",
BACK TO SCENE,
"Selena steps away from the pool, shaken by the sight",
ETHAN,
What,
?,
SELENA,
You don't get this far without paying a certain price,
"She turns and walks quickly out of the conservatory, followed by Ethan",
MR. DANVERS,
If only I hadn't made that speech denouncing her,
MRS . DANVERS,
I'm not afraid to die,
I'm proud of you,
She stretches out her hand through the bars and clasps his bravely,
Lucy turns her face away to give them some privacy in their final moments,
Jimmy is looking at her,
JIMMY,
(shyly),
I've been in love with you for years,
Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom?,
And put your fingerprints on my lens,
LUCY,
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention,
JIMMY,
You were? You mean we could've been you-know-what all this time?,
LUCY,
You bet your ass,
JIMMY,
Why didn't you tell me?,
LUCY,
You're supposed to guess,
"She reaches out her hand through the bars and clasps his bravely, like the Danvers",
INT,
THE PHANTOM ZONE/QUANTUM VORTEX,
"Zaltar is continuing his climb, but the way is getting steeper, and he is tired and short of breath",
He pauses,
SUPERGIRL,
Why are you stopping?,
ZALTAR,
Stopping? Was I? Silly,
One thing you musn't do,
"He continues forward, and upward, firming their path with the matterwand",
The wand creates a warm circle of white light around them in contrast to the monochromatic energy field of the Phantom Zone,
"Because of the inherent curvature of the Phantom Zone vortex, they seem to be scrambling up a sheer vertical wall now",
"Supergirl is close beside Zaltar helping him along, not merely following as she had before",
The throbbing sound of energy waves surging down the vortex is growing louder as they proceed,
"Zaltar stumbles, and drops the matterwand",
ZALTAR,
Oh dear!,
"The vortex starts to sweep the wand backwards, down to where they have just climbed from",
Supergirl makes a desperate lunge and retrieves the wand as it sweeps past,
But now she is being swept backwards,
ZALTAR,
The wand,
Use it,
Supergirl somehow finds the right grip on the controls and points the wand at the undulating surface beneath her,
She stills the moving surface and stops her backwards motion,
ZALTAR,
Good girl! That's the way!,
But now Zaltar is being swept backwards toward her,
She points the wand at his feet and halts his downhill slide,
ZALTAR,
You can use the wand,
SUPERGIRL,
Better than when I was a child,
She hands it back to him and they resume their slow upward progress,
ZALTAR,
I remember you then,
Cute thing you were,
Like your mother,
CUT TO:,
INT,
SELENA'S NEW LIVING ROOM,
Selena stands watching the image of Zaltar and Supergirl in her mirror,
"Beside her on the floor is the Coffer of Shadow, now swollen to the size of a large pumpkin",
It pulses and glows with inner light,
The lid of the Coffer of Shadow starts to rattle as if something inside is attempting to get out,
INT,
THE PHANTOM ZONE/QUANTUM VORTEX,
Flaming spheres of BALL LIGHTNING begin to whizz past Zaltar and Supergirl,
"Zaltar is startled, and he stops his forward progress",
ZALTAR,
What's that? Never saw anything like that,
SUPERGIRL,
Don't stop,
Keep moving,
ZALTAR,
"Yes, mustn't stop",
SUPERGIRL,
(grimly),
It's Selena,
I'm getting so I can recognise her work,
Another flaming sphere whizzes toward them,
It hits Zaltar on the shoulder and knocks him off the safe path,
He starts to roll backwards down the vortex,
SUPERGIRL,
Zaltar,
Use the wand!,
ZALTAR,
Too late,
Too late,
Save yourself,
"He is being swept faster and faster away from her, receding like the image of Ethan when she was trapped in the zone",
"Zaltar throws the wand to her, and then is swept away, out of sight, downward to his death",
He calls out after he disappears,
ZALTAR,
(voice over),
Goodbye,
SUPERGIRL,
Zaltar!,
"She begins to be swept backwards, but she uses the wand, and stops her slide",
"Gripping the wand fiercely, she starts to forge ahead",
All the while she has to dodge the flaming spheres that Selena sends down the vortex,
SUPERGIRL,
"You're not going to win, Selena",
I won't let you,
Suddenly Supergirl enters another area of the vortex,
"She begins to move forward, upward, without clawing her way",
"She accelerates, moving faster and faster",
EXT,
GRASSY MEADOW BESIDE A POND,
"Supergirl lands, in a deserted sunny meadow",
She collapses sobbing on the grass,
The matterwand lies beside her,
SUPERGIRL,
"Zaltar, Zaltar",
You never had a selfish heart,
"She looks up at the sun shining down serenely, bathing the Earth in its life-giving rays---and returning her superpowers to her",
SUPERGIRL,
"Wherever you are, Zaltar, thank 'you",

She stands up and flexes her muscles,
She no longer looks tired or disheveled,
Her red and blue costume shines in the bright sunlight,

ETHAN,
She has hostages,
SELENA,

LIVING ROOM,
DAY,
Selena witnesses the destruction of her hostage scheme,
SELENA,
"All right, Supergirl",
The game's not over till the last card's dealt,
Selena opens the lid of the grotesquely swollen Coffer of Shadow sitting beside her on the floor,
The OMEGAHEDRON inside spins,
All the FURNITURE in the room suddenly launches itself at Supergirl,
"Huge oak refectory tables, alabaster thrones, marble urns, iron firegrates, shie1ds and armour, bronze statuary, and razor sharp panes of glass from the windows all shatter themselves against her invulnerable body",
"Ethan stands in the corner, ducking the stray fragments that come his way",
SUPERGIRL,
"You've run out of things to throw, Selena",
,
SELENA,
Not yet,
Selena points her hand at Supergirl with a gesture of attack,
The COFFER OF SHADOW emits a dense black mist that darkens the room,
A giant invisible hand seizes Supergirl and hurls her into the alchemical bar with a crash of bottles,
Supergirl stands up with the wand held in front of her to ward off another attack,
ETHAN,
It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!,
SUPERGIRL,
How do I fight it?,
ETHAN,
Turn it against her,
Supergirl raises the wand and APPLIES IT TO HER OWN BODY,
"THERE IS A FLASH OF BLINDING LIGHT, and Supergirl is transformed into a perfect image of Selena---as she was at the fairgrounds",
"There are now two Selenas in the room---the real one beside the Coffer of shadow, and the one holding the matterwand in the alchemical bar",
"The Real Selena is first astonished, and then furious",
REAL SELENA,
"Power of Shadow, kill her!!",
The Second Selena calls out to the SHADOW-SELF in Selena's own unmistakable voice,
SECOND SELENA,
No,
I am your mistress,
Do not harm me,
REAL SELENA,
Don't listen to her! Kill her! She's lying,
SECOND SELENA,
"You are my shadow, you must obey me",
The Real Selena is distracted by the duel of willpower with her double and doesn't notice Ethan creeping along the wall toward the Coffer of Shadow,
"Ethan lunges for the shining OMEGAHEDRON inside, and snatches it out just as the heavy lid slams shut with a clang of metal",
"Ethan rolls over and over on the floor, away from Selena, clutching the, shining ring to him like a football in the end zone after a quarterback sneak on a fourth down trailing seven to six with three seconds on the clock",
ETHAN,
I've got it! The Power Source!,
The Real Se1ena cries out with despair,
And then the SHADOW attacks her,
The Real Selena cries out as she is surrounded by a black mist that starts slowly choking the life out of her,
REAL SELENA,
(terrified),
No! Stop! Please!,
Ethan hands the Power Source to the Second Selena in the bar,
,
SECOND SELENA,
Thank you,
I'll take this back to Argo City,
ETHAN,
"It is you, then, really?",
"Without a word, the Second Selena kisses him on the lips",
SECOND SELENA,
Well?,
ETHAN,
It's you all right,
SECOND SELENA,
I'll make it easy for you,
She again APPLIES THE WAND TO HER OWN BODY,
"There is a flash of light, and once more Supergirl stands before him, clutching both the Power Source and the wand",
ETHAN,
"I couldn't help what I did, before",
She drugged me,
SUPERGIRL,
I never doubted you for a moment,
REAL SELENA,
Supergirl,
Please! Help! I'm dying,
Supergirl steps toward the corner of the room beside the mirror where the Real Selena is imprisoned in the cloud of blackness,
Supergirl touches the SHADOW with her wand,
"There is a cosmic musical chord, and the SHADOW is destroyed it falls to the floor in a rain of hard, dark cinders",
The Real Selena rises from the corner of the room where she was released from the grip of the shadow,
She looks at herself in the mirror,
"She is changed into the softer, more innocent person she was at the picnic before she found the Omegahedron",
THERE IS NO MORE EVIL SHADOW LOOMING BEHIND HER IN THE MIRROR REFLECTION,
She turns to Supergirl and Ethan,
SELENA,
I'm free,
I can never thank you enough,
SUPERGIRL,
For what?,
,
Selena points to the glittering OMEGAHEDRON Supergirl holds,
SELENA,
Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare,
You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time,
SUPERGIRL,
Your nightmares are over,
I'm taking this back to,
Argo City where it won't be misused,
(to Ethan),
You could come too,
It might be safer for you,
ETHAN,
No thanks,
I have friends in the resistance,
They'll vouch for me,
I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs,
SUPERGIRL,
I'll come back as soon as I can,
SELENA,
"What about me? They'll make, hash out of me around here",
Supergirl and Ethan exchange a glance,
Selena's innocence is the one problem they have not foreseen,
ETHAN,
She's right,
They'll string her up,
SUPERGIRL,
Do you want to come to Argo City?,
SELENA,
What's it like?,
SUPERGIRL,
It's the most beautiful place in the universe,
SELENA,
Sounds O,
K to me,
Let's go,
Supergirl holds out the matterwand to Selena,
